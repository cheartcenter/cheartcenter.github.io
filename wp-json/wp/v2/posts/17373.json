From designer options delivered monthly, to your standard grocery store finds, your choices are seemingly endless. And whether budget and environmental concerns or skin sensitivity and fashion top your list, your diaper needs are going to be as unique as your baby. Here\u2019s what you need to know to pick the best<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> diapers for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Best diapers for newborns<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we can\u2019t recommend a specific brand for your newborn, there are a few things you\u2019ll want to look out for. First of all, you\u2019re going to want to go scent free. Babies have super sensitive skin and perfumes can irritate it. If your goal is not to have a poopy-smelling baby, your best bet is to change your little one as quickly as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second big concern when it comes to newborn diapers is size. While most companies make a newborn size, it&#8217;s not right for every newborn. If your baby&#8217;s on the larger side, it might make more sense to have them in a size one instead. Few things are worse than an uncomfortable newborn squeezed into a too-tight diaper! Which brings us to our next subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to choose the right diaper size<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diapers are sized by weight. But much like clothing sizes, there isn\u2019t a standard, industry-wide fit. A size one in \u201cBrand A\u201d might fit babies between eight and 14 pounds, while the same size in \u201cBrand B\u201d is for four to 11 pound babies. But even when your baby falls into one size&#8217;s weight range, that&#8217;s no guarantee it&#8217;ll be their best fit. If your baby\u2019s diaper is too tight or they\u2019re having frequent blowouts, it\u2019s probably time to size up \u2014 even if they\u2019re in the right weight range. So while sales can make it tempting to stock up, beware the urge to fill your house. It may seem like it&#8217;ll be forever until your little one grows into the next size, but they\u2019ll get there sooner than you think.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Best diapers for baby boys<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the penis factor, baby boys face some unique issues when it comes to diapering. To reduce your little guy\u2019s chances of waking up wet, make sure to point his penis down when putting his diaper on before bedtime. This will (hopefully) keep it from soaking the waistband of his diaper which is typically the least absorbent part. If he continues to wake up wet despite this, try switching to the overnight (ie more absorbent) version of your diaper brand. If this still doesn\u2019t work, you might have a heavy wetter on your hands. In this case, try adding a diaper insert \u2014 there are both disposable and reusable ones on the market. But no matter how frustrating changing him multiple times a night is, never restrict the amount of liquid you give your little guy. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/dehydration.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies and young children can dehydrate <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easily with dangerous consequences. If night wetting becomes a chronic issue, speak to your child\u2019s pediatrician about how to safely drop a night feed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How much do diapers cost?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost is a major factor for most parents when it comes to raising a child. If you consider <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how many diapers a day per newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re going to use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/a-parents-guide-to-baby-poop\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(between 6-8)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over the course of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/goodbye-diapers-hello-potty-training-methods\/\">two (or more!) years <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that really adds up. Those high-end, 63-cents-a-diaper brands end up being A LOT more expensive than your average 19 cent ones. Even within brands there can be a lot of variation \u2014 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pampers.com\/en-us\/diapers-wipes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pampers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes nine <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">types of diapers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least, and some are significantly cheaper than others. So if you have the time to shop around, it can make a big difference over the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to pick an eco-friendly diaper<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re worried about your environmental impact, there are a number of disposable diaper companies that claim to be eco-friendly. It can be hard, however, to find unbiased information supporting their claims. If you have specific environmental concerns, you might want to consider using cloth diapers instead (more on those below).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Types of cloth diapers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few different <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">types of cloth diapers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out there. Prefold cloth diapers are the OGs. They&#8217;re essentially rectangles of cloth and if your parents used cloth diapers, these are probably what they had for you. While absorbent, they aren\u2019t always the quickest to put on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern cloth ones tend to be similar to disposables in terms of shape which makes them easier to use. Some come in two or more pieces with a waterproof cover and an inner liner or liners for absorbency, while others come in one piece. If you decide to go with cloth, you\u2019ll also have to decide on using a diaper service vs. laundering them yourself. By far the cheapest option is to buy (or inherit) a set of cloth diapers and launder them at home yourself. If you do this, however, it\u2019s crucial that you follow the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines or you risk making the process unhygienic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot of judgement out there when it comes to raising kids, but your diaper pick doesn\u2019t define you as a parent. And unlike other status symbols like designer baby booties or $2,000 strollers, diapers are largely invisible to other parents. As long as you&#8217;re change your little one often enough, what you put on their bum doesn\u2019t matter. So go ahead and hand make your baby\u2019s diapers. Or buy those sustainably-harvested, dye-free, plant-based ones. But if you prefer buying what\u2019s on sale at the grocery store, know that that\u2019s more than ok too.
