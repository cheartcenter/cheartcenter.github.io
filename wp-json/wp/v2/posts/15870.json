Figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to make<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby sleep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, is a different story. Wondering <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to get your baby to sleep in their bassinet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of your arms, or when (oh, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when?!) do babies sleep through the night<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? You\u2019ve come to the right place. Grab your (probably cold) coffee and your very awake baby, and let us walk you through the basics of baby sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to get your newborn to sleep without being held<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some babies are born sleepers. Others make you wait two and a half years to get a proper night\u2019s sleep (or longer). Luckily, nothing is constant where babies are concerned. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby sleep patterns<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vary <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by age<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so the way your two-week-old is sleeping (or not) is going to look quite different than how they sleep at six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most newborns have to eat every two to three hours, so they\u2019re not likely to sleep for longer than that at a stretch. The good news is they\u2019ll pretty much pass out no matter what is going on around them at this stage. Figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to put a newborn baby to sleep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> usually just involves nursing them. If they tend to wake up when you transfer them to their bed, try swaddling them. You can also keep your hand on their tummy as you put them down and remove it little by little once they\u2019re settled. This should make the absence of your warmth less noticeable and less likely to wake them up. No matter how they get to sleep though, once they are the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safest sleep position<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is on their back. Once they\u2019re able to roll over they can decide how they prefer to sleep, but until then, the back is always the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best sleeping position for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after feeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to make your baby sleep<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your baby<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleeping fast<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sure they have a predictable schedule. Bedtime, wake time and most naps should happen at about the same every day and in the same place as much as possible. Some babies can nap on the go, but many find it dysregulating to sleep anywhere other than their crib.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many parents choose to sleep train their little ones, while others prefer nursing or rocking their baby to sleep. Either is fine as long as it\u2019s right for your family. And if all else fails, a car ride or a walk in the stroller or carrier can help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby sleep problems<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/welcoming-babys-first-teeth\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teething<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to developmental milestones to separation anxiety, many things can affect your baby\u2019s sleep. Luckily most won\u2019t disrupt it for more than a couple of weeks. If your child\u2019s sleep trouble lasts longer than a month, or if they snore or complain of itchy legs, it\u2019s a good idea to take them to the doctor. It could be a sign of a sleep disorder like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/chronic-diseases\/sleep-apnea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep apnea<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/ue4938\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restless leg syndrome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby sleep problem<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you\u2019ll likely encounter at some point, however, is the dreaded overtired baby. When grownups get overtired, our urge to sleep increases. But in babies, the more overtired they are, the harder it can be to get them to sleep. Sometimes they\u2019re so tired that they pass out quite easily, but their sleep is likely to be shorter and more interrupted than if they are properly rested. To keep them from getting overtired, keep your baby on an age appropriate sleep schedule \u2014 which brings us to our next topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby sleep schedules<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep schedule<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> around the four month mark is a great way to establish good sleep habits. Their sleep pattern changes around this point, and they start to need more support falling and staying asleep. Successful baby sleep is really a matter of routine. A short pre-bed routine of bath, books and bed cues baby that it\u2019s time to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep time <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should happen at roughly the same times each day. Many parents find success using the \u201cwake windows\u201d system, which involves putting your baby to sleep a set period of time after their last wakeup (see our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby sleep chart<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> below for more info). But be warned \u2014 most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep schedules<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who can have more than a 40 minute nap. If your baby can\u2019t extend their naps yet, most schedules won\u2019t work for you. In this case you can either try adding an extra nap each day or push your baby into an early bedtime (hello 5:30). You can also try to help them extend their nap by sleeping with them or putting them in the carrier to nap (if those help). It\u2019s not a good idea to sleep train a baby who can\u2019t extend their naps yet because they\u2019ll probably be too overtired to get it successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby sleep chart by age<\/h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Age<\/b><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/healthy_sleep_for_your_baby_and_child\"><b>Total sleep needs a day<\/b><\/a><\/td>\n<td><b>Wake window (time awake between naps)<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Number of naps<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>0-3 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 18 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">45 min-1.5 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A whole bunch!<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>4-6 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12-16 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.25-2.5 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-4 naps<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>7-8 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12-16 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.25-3 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2-3 naps<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>9-12 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12-16 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.5-4 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 naps<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>13-17 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11-14 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-4 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1-2 naps<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>18-24 months<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11-14 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.5-6 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 nap<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can take a while, but kids do get the hang of sleeping eventually.
