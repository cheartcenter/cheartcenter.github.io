It didn\u2019t matter how long I slept, I was chronically tired and just dragging myself around. I was having increasing difficulty waking up\u00a0and I was very depressed. One day I remember sitting in my bedroom when everyone was out of the house and just crying. I couldn\u2019t figure out why.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie went to see her doctor who performed a blood test as part of her workup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy doctor looked at the results and said, \u201cWell, you have a slightly under-active thyroid. It\u2019s not huge, but I\u2019m going to give you a small dose of Thyroxine. And within three days of taking it, I couldn\u2019t believe the difference. It was day and night. My husband noticed it right away. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re bounding out of bed in the morning, just like the old you!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is hypothyroidism?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie has hypothyroidism. Also known as under-active thyroid, hypothyroidism is when your thyroid gland doesn\u2019t produce enough hormones to regulate your bodily functions. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the front of the neck which produces hormones that control virtually every cell in our body by regulating our metabolism. This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/thyroid-disease-the-symptoms-you-need-to-know-about\/\">when our thyroid is off<\/a>, it derails our other bodily processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of hypothyroidism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle and gradual, making it difficult to detect. They\u2019re also non-specific, so it&#8217;s easy to mistake them for many different things (including ageing). Like many women, this was the case for Jackie:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn terms of other symptoms, I had gained a little bit of weight, but not a lot. And my skin\u2019s always been on the dry side. I did notice that I had hair loss, but I wasn\u2019t really focused on those symptoms, I was focused on the profound lack of energy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms of under-active thyroid are varied but can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight gain<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hair loss<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exhaustion<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constipation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes to menstrual cycle<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dry skin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBrain fog,\u201d forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased sensitivity to cold<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Getting a diagnosis of hypothyroidism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The upside is that both the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">test<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypothyroidism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and its <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are quite\u00a0straightforward. A simple blood test measures your thyroid stimulating hormone or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TSH levels<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to diagnose <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypothyroidism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medication<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is prescribed if your levels of TSH are found to be above a certain threshold \u2014 our bodies produce more to try and stimulate the thyroid into doing its job. Levels below a certain threshold, in contrast, signal hyperthyroidism, which is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/thyroid-disease-the-symptoms-you-need-to-know-about\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over-active thyroid<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Causes of hypothyroidism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyroid.org\/hashimotos-thyroiditis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can have a genetic basis. In Jackie\u2019s case, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she discovered from a cousin that many of the women in her family have under-active thyroid.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hypothyroidism can often accompany ageing, and some women can develop <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/diseases\/15294-postpartum-thyroiditis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum thyroiditis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the year following a pregnancy. Symptoms of this thyroid dysfunction are often subtle, and may begin with hyperthyroidism before turning into hypothyroidism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other cases, external factors cause the\u00a0dysfunction. Certain viruses can affect the functioning of the thyroid, as can radiation to the head and neck area. In more remote parts of the world, a lack of iodine causes hypothyroidism, since iodine is necessary for proper thyroid function.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hypothyroidism in women vs. men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyroid.org\/media-main\/press-room\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five to eight times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more likely to develop thyroid issues than men, and research suggests that up to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/diseases\/12120-hypothyroidism\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of women over the age of 50 are affected by hypothyroidism. Despite the differences in prevalence, symptoms of an under-active thyroid manifest in much the same way in both genders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hypothyroidism in children<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congenital hypothyroidism arises when a child is born with an under-active thyroid, or without one altogether. Because the gland is necessary for normal brain development and growth, doctors test the thyroid function of every child born in Canada. Children whose thyroid is under-active may need to take hormones for the rest of their lives, while others will recover proper thyroid function after a time. In both cases, these children will develop and function normally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hypothyroidism treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the debilitating nature of an under-active thyroid, treatment is usually quite\u00a0straightforward. Once diagnosed, patients are treated with synthetic versions of the thyroid hormones. They should have their hormone levels tested regularly to ensure they continue to maintain appropriate dosing level and will likely be referred to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/endocrinologist\/\">endocrinologist<\/a>. Endocrinologists specialize in the body&#8217;s hormones, so they&#8217;re go-tos for thyroid conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypothyroidism diet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d for patients to follow, some foods may block medications from being absorbed properly. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.btf-thyroid.org\/information\/108-thyroid-and-diet-factsheet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calcium and soy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, can interfere and should therefore not be taken at the same time as medication. For further information, patients can speak to their doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For women like Jackie who have received a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, there is a happy ending: \u201cI\u2019m now taking double the dose of Thyroxine I was originally, but that\u2019s over a twenty year period. My doctor tests my levels every year, but I haven\u2019t increased my dose for over a decade. It&#8217;s shocking that a small amount of medication makes such a vast difference in my life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you may have symptoms of hypothyroidism, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/features\/lab-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get in touch with us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
