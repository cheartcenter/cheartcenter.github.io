You could be experiencing low testosterone levels. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you dismiss this as a possibility, it\u2019s important to note that not only do one in four men have low testosterone, but less than 5% of cases are diagnosed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s an extremely low percentage of diagnosed cases. It also means there are a significant number of men who have low testosterone levels, but haven\u2019t gotten help yet. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low testosterone is nothing to be embarrassed about, but for some men, the symptoms this condition can cause can feel embarrassing to discuss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without help, this condition won\u2019t go away on its own. To help men identify symptoms of potentially low testosterone levels, we\u2019ve put together a list of five common identifying signs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before we talk about some recognizable signs of low testosterone, let\u2019s talk about testosterone itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What is testosterone?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testosterone is a hormone that\u2019s produced by the human body. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is some testosterone in women, produced through a combination of the adrenal gland and ovaries, but in much smaller volumes than men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A man\u2019s testosterone is produced through his testicles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why is testosterone important to us?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A man\u2019s appearance, as well as his sexual drive and development, is affected by testosterone. When a man\u2019s testosterone levels are low, it can have negative impacts on multiple others areas of his body as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testosterone also plays a role in building muscle and bone mass for both men and women.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1) It\u2019s affecting your sex life<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s normally had a high sex drive, and now find yourself uninterested in sex, low testosterone could be to blame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only could low testosterone levels affect your interest in sex, but they could also impact your ability to perform. This could manifest as difficulty getting or maintaining an erection or through a lower-than-normal volume of semen released during ejaculation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These symptoms can feel emasculating and encourage other negative symptoms like anxiety or depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2) You\u2019re tired all the time<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have your energy levels been down recently? Do you feel exhausted after the smallest tasks, or too tired to even bother doing the things you normally enjoy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve already tried getting more sleep at night, but aren\u2019t finding it makes a difference, the issue could be your testosterone levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This symptom can have a huge impact on your daily life, pushing you away from the things you love to do. Also, avoiding physical activities because you\u2019re tired all the time can worsen other symptoms like weight gain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3) You\u2019ve been putting on weight<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men that have low testosterone can experience an increase in body fat, particularly around the abdominal and chest regions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, this can even lead to gynecomastia, also known as enlarged breast tissue. It\u2019s believed this could be caused by affecting the balance between testosterone and estrogen levels in men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many men, this symptom can make them feel ashamed, even if they\u2019ve been following a healthy regimen of diet and exercise. This embarrassment may make them feel hesitant to get medical advice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality is that reversing this symptom may require treating your low testosterone levels first. So, speaking to an endocrinologist through Maple could be exactly what you need to get your weight back under control.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4) You\u2019ve noticed strange hair loss<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Male pattern baldness is extremely common. It affects more than 50% of all men over the age of 50, to some extent. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, low testosterone levels can cause hair loss, or affect hair on other parts of the body (i.e., facial hair, pubic hair, etc.). It can also cause hair to become thinner, rather than falling out completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s unusual to begin losing body hair without cause. In these situations, it\u2019s good to make sure you have your hormone levels tested through an endocrinologist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5) You\u2019re having mood swings<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormones have a huge impact on our moods and mental states, so it\u2019s no surprise that low testosterone levels would lead to changes in mood. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re finding yourself feeling irritable, anxious, or depressed, and you don\u2019t know why, it could be the result of low testosterone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low testosterone levels can also affect your ability to focus and your memory, which can have a huge impact on your ability to function.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>When should I speak with an endocrinologist?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endocrinologists are specialists who have expertise in dealing with hormone imbalances, like low testosterone. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re experiencing some of the symptoms above, it could be a good idea to meet with an endocrinologist. They\u2019ll be able to arrange to have your testosterone levels checked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may be able to offer helpful treatment options, but first you\u2019ll need to have testing done to confirm a diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Can Maple help me if I have low testosterone?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes!\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endocrinology is one of our top specialties. We can put you in touch with a physician or endocrinologist who will help you identify the cause of your symptoms. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a diagnosis, we\u2019ll be able to suggest treatment options that can help you minimize your symptoms and manage your condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low testosterone is nothing to be embarrassed about.
