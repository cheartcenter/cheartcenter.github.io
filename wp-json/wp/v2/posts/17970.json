So if you\u2019re thinking to yourself, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my child is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walking or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">running flat-footed<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d you\u2019re right! While flat feet or fallen arches might cause you some discomfort, they\u2019re not typically cause for concern in little ones. In fact, it\u2019s unusual for fallen <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arches <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cause <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foot pain<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your little one\u2019s flat feet are always normal. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about flat feet in babies and toddlers \u2014 from what\u2019s normal, to when it\u2019s time to see a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pediatric orthotist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is pediatric flatfoot?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flat feet in toddlers are so common that there\u2019s a name for the condition: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pediatric flatfoot<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (yes, it\u2019s one word) or flexible flat feet. Because they\u2019re growing so rapidly, children\u2019s bones are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\/health-issues\/injuries-emergencies\/Pages\/Children-And-Broken-Bones.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more flexible<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than adult bones. This is great for some things \u2014 if they break a bone, they\u2019ll heal more quickly than a grownup would, for example. It also means that when they stand up, the weight of their body is enough to flatten the arch right out of their cute little feet. This pretty much guarantees that your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flat feet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Once they sit down, however, their foot should regain its arch. This usually stops happening by about age 10 when most children grow out of their flexible flat feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to see a pediatric orthotist<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main concerns with flat feet is pain. In some adults, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flat feet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be foot, hip, knee and even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.urmc.rochester.edu\/encyclopedia\/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&amp;ContentID=1158\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">back pain<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The good news is that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> kids with flexible flat feet don\u2019t have pain \u2014 but this isn\u2019t always the case. If your child or preteen is complaining of foot pain or regular discomfort in their back, knees or hips, they should see a doctor. They might need orthotic inserts for their shoes or something else might be going on physically with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as they\u2019re the flexible version, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">child\u2019s flat feet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But if your child\u2019s foot doesn\u2019t regain its arch when they\u2019re sitting, they likely have a different condition. Total absence of an arch in the foot is called <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rigid<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> flatfoot. Kids with rigid flatfoot need to see a doctor as the condition can sometimes be symptomatic of another condition like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/diseases\/17005-flatfoot#:~:text=Rigid%20flatfoot%20is%20caused%20by,or%20stretched%20tendon%2C%20or%20arthritis.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cerebral palsy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or be caused by an injury. In these cases, your little one might need a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pediatric orthotist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> referral to assess their need for orthotic inserts for their shoes or other treatment. But while it can be serious in some cases, rigid flatfoot doesn\u2019t impact the majority of the people who have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat flat feet<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you\u2019ve seen a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pediatric orthotist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and they\u2019ve told you otherwise, you don&#8217;t need <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">orthopedic shoes for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flat-footed toddler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best shoes for toddlers with flat feet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the same shoes any toddler would get \u2014 regular shoes with enough room for their feet and grippy soles. So unless your child has a really unusual gait, there\u2019s nothing for you to do except wait. Their arch should develop somewhere between ages <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/a_to_z\/fallen-arch-a-to-z\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven and 10<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">see a doctor<\/a> for any pain, if your child does experience tight heel cords (also known as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tr1808\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achilles tendon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) they can try some simple stretching <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exercises for treating flat foot<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> discomfort. The main stretch involves pushing against a wall with both hands with one foot in front of the other. If they\u2019re feeling it in the back of their calf, they\u2019re doing it right. If not, they can try moving their back foot further back from the wall. Just make sure they have a good grip with their feet to avoid sliding out and down face first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most children outgrow their flat feet by age 10 as their bones begin to harden. If your 11-year-old is still walking around with flat feet though, don\u2019t despair. Some people retain their flat feet throughout their lives without issue. The condition of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flat foot is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hereditary<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so chances are good that you or your partner has the same issue. When it comes to your kid, any abnormalities are always concerning for parents. But with flat feet, if they\u2019re not in pain, there\u2019s probably nothing to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When are flat feet and fallen arches normal
