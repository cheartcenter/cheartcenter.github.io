We can finally look forward to the end of quarantine, and the end of the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one is happier for this news than parents. Finally, schools can fully re-open, daycare can resume, and the house will be quiet for a moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, these peaceful dreams have to go on hold a bit longer. The vaccines currently being discussed in the news are for adults, not children. Children have a different physiology than adults, so they\u2019ll require a vaccine that\u2019s been approved especially for them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the COVID-19 vaccine?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A vaccine is a type of medicine that introduces a non-harmful sample of a specific disease into your body. Your body produces antibodies to fight the invading pathogen, even though it\u2019s already been neutralized in a lab. The next time you encounter the pathogen in daily life, in its fully-active form, your body will be able to fight it off before you get seriously sick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 vaccine will have either an inactive or attenuated sample of the virus. Inactive means the virus sample was killed before incorporation into the vaccine. An attenuated sample of COVID-19 means the virus is still alive, but significantly weakened.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for expecting mothers?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, the COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for pregnant people. Vaccines have to go through extensive testing before they\u2019re available to the public. The COVID-19 vaccines in the news, like from Pfizer and Moderna, haven\u2019t been tested on pregnant people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/media\/releases\/2020\/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data shows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that pregnant people are at significantly higher risk for getting COVID-19, but are not at greater risk for death. Doctors have to be careful about vaccinating people in high-risk groups to manage the risk of side-effects versus the risk of contracting the illness.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When will a children\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine be ready?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We already have a vaccine for adults, which is great news. But researchers still have to determine what dosage level is safe for children. This process is expected to take several months. The current guess is that a kid\u2019s vaccine will be ready by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health-news\/heres-when-we-may-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-for-children\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">late summer or fall 2021<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do vaccines need to be tested on children and teenagers?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids have been mostly left out of clinical trials so far. Researchers want to make sure their vaccines are safe and effective in adults before administering them to kids.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young people are still growing and maturing. Their immune systems <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/kids-vaccine-covid-19-1.5826606\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aren\u2019t fully-developed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and they tend to have stronger immune reactions to vaccines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all the adults are vaccinated, will that provide herd immunity for children?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herd immunity is when the majority of a population is immune from a specific disease, so it can\u2019t spread easily. This can help protect more vulnerable members of the population who can\u2019t receive vaccinations because of their immune systems.Through vaccinations, we\u2019ve achieved herd immunity to diseases like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/apic.org\/monthly_alerts\/herd-immunity\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smallpox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and polio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with so much about COVID-19, we don\u2019t know if herd immunity will be possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the adult COVID-19 vaccine will be a great relief, it\u2019s not a complete solution to the pandemic. Parents will still need to protect their kids from contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to other members of their community. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if case numbers go down once the adult vaccine is given to the majority of eligible Canadians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, staying home and taking care of your health is of utmost importance. You can see a doctor online, 24\/7, to get health advice, treatment, and prescriptions delivered right to your door.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s the news we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 a vaccine for COVID-19 is ready.
