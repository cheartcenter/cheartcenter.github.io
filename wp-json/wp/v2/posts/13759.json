A team that is healthy, happy, and secure operates like a well oiled machine. People are more content to work for a company that truly cares about their well-being. Whatever your company goals are, they\u2019ll be accelerated by an engaged and healthy workforce.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has brought the topic of Canadians\u2019 health to the forefront. We\u2019ve seen the inextricable link between the health of the greater populace and business\u2019s ability to stay afloat. The economy has changed, certainly in the short term, and very likely in the long term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Canadian businesses re-open and employees return to the office, health is on top of everyone\u2019s minds. In addition to keeping workers safe, employers are wondering how they can create a culture that maximizes health. To this end, an exploding trend is for companies to reexamine, or create from scratch, their corporate healthcare and wellness strategy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a corporate wellness strategy, and why is it important?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A corporate wellness strategy, usually overseen by a company\u2019s human resources department, is a series of goals and tracking milestones aimed to improve employee satisfaction ratings and lower business overhead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Absenteeism<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee absenteeism, more plainly known as sick days, cost employers around $2,000 per employee each year. It\u2019s natural that employees would need to take a few days off if they\u2019ve come down with the flu or undergone a major surgery. What many employers are finding, however, is that chronic health problems, mental stress, and preventable health episodes are driving more and more worker absenteeism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Fight disengagement<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving a company\u2019s wellness culture brings intangible benefits that add up to be hugely valuable over the long run. The pervading office culture is a company\u2019s internal brand. A company that makes its employees feel healthy, safe, and valued in turn receives workers who are highly engaged. On the flipside, employee disengagement costs companies huge. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/karlynborysenko\/2019\/05\/02\/how-much-are-your-disengaged-employees-costing-you\/#25aa76983437\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to one poll<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, disengaged workers have 37% higher absenteeism rates, are 18% less productive, and are 15% less profitable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Attract and retain talent<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fantastic health and wellness strategy is a huge differentiator for your company when attempting to attract and retain top talent. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/d7deb342-3775-4e2f-ae9b-05e07decd318\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200703%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200703T131557Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=19837356b57f3c40055d8787433f07f7e18d355dc69785778e9a5ea8b7c91789&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf%22\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">86% of survey respondents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> say that wellness culture is an important factor when deciding whether to accept a job offer, or to stay at their current job. Highly skilled workers can afford to be choosy when shopping multiple job offers, and will often select the company that seems the best fit for their overall lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Avoid an employee skills gap<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies that want to be competitive in their market need a highly competitive workforce. Conversely, companies that uphold a revolving door culture will find their employee skill level permanently stunted. This is known as the employee skills gap, and it occurs when employees leave a job before they\u2019re fully trained and productive. Since it takes most employees 1-2 years to be firing on all cylinders in their job, high turnover means that companies will always be lagging behind and relying on stressed, under-performing employees. A revolving door culture tends to emerge when a company neglects the well-being of it\u2019s workers, or fails to keep pace with the industry standard for overall culture and compensation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to create a corporate wellness strategy<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Set goals<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most successful corporate healthcare and wellness strategies start with clear objectives. To make sure that the strategy gains widespread acceptance and adherence, make it tied to business goals. Top-level company KPIs should incorporate employee wellness objectives. For example, what is the average score for employee workplace satisfaction? What are employee retention rates? Showing employees that culture and well-being are high priorities will create a positive trickle down effect throughout your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Identify challenges<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What current factors are at play that are lowering the wellness of your workplace? Are there strained relationships, overloading of work, or lack of healthy food options? After setting goals, identify the challenges that made those goals necessities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Choose one or two opportunities<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t try to boil the ocean in your first attempt at a corporate wellness strategy. Rather than looking to heal the whole office, choose a couple high-importance areas to focus on. You\u2019ll be able to track results and make progress against one or two well-selected goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Create a plan of action<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After choosing your highest priority goals and identifying your challenges, carve out a plan of action to tackle them. Say you want to improve absenteeism rates. Your plan of action might include collecting data about current absenteeism rates, identifying the main reasons behind time off, and taking clear steps to address those reasons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5. Create an initial benchmark score<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To measure whether your corporate wellness plan is working, you must be measuring against an established benchmark. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have no idea whether things are improving or degrading. You can create a benchmark by surveying your employees, and looking at company data related to your wellness goals. If surveying your employees, make questions detailed so that answers will be as close to objective as possible. Giving vague questions like \u201cHow satisfied are you with your job?\u201d are subject to an employee\u2019s broad judgement. Questions like \u201cI feel stressed at least one day each week\u201d are more specific and telling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>6. Carve out time<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main factor that puts corporate wellness plans on hold is lack of time given towards the project. This stems from leadership attitudes that employee wellbeing is not as valuable as initiatives that are tied to immediate monetary gain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wellness strategy leaders must be deliberate in how they allot their time to ensure health goals are pushed forward. Tying wellness goals into top-level company KPIs is a great way to state that employee wellness is a company mandate, and to remind leadership that a wellness culture is innately tied to a business\u2019s success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Things to keep in mind when creating a wellness strategy<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mental health<b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadians will experience a mental illness or addiction problem in any given year.
