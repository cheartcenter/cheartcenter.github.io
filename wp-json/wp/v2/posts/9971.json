From hair loss to newfound incontinence, carrying a baby can change your body in so many ways. Growing a baby takes a herculean effort, and giving birth doesn\u2019t mean your body\u2019s finished changing. Most new moms know to look out for mood changes that might signal postpartum depression, but there\u2019s a lot more to your postpartum recovery. Let\u2019s take a look at all the ways your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">body changes after giving birth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your uterus after pregnancy<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During pregnancy, your uterus grows to accommodate your baby. So it follows that after your baby is born, your uterus will be larger than normal. This is part of the reason you\u2019ll still look pregnant for a while after you give birth. For the first few days postpartum, you\u2019ll feel small contractions or cramping, especially while breastfeeding (if you are). These cramps are actually your uterus shrinking back to its pre-pregnancy size. The uterus starts shrinking within minutes of giving birth, but it takes about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwh.org\/patient-guides-and-forms\/postpartum-guide\/postpartum-chapter-2\/postpartum-care-pain-management\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six weeks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to fully return to its previous size. If you\u2019re concerned that your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uterus<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not shrinking after pregnancy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or you still look pregnant after the two-month mark, speak to your doctor or your local pelvic floor physiotherapist. You may have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whattoexpect.com\/pregnancy\/pregnancy-health\/diastasis-recti-and-pregnancy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diastasis recti<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a common post-pregnancy condition in which a gap appears between the two sides of the abdominal muscles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bleeding and perineum care<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you deliver vaginally or have a c-section, you\u2019ll experience bleeding after giving birth, otherwise known as lochia. This bleeding is how your postpartum body gets rid of any extra tissue and blood left over from pregnancy. Lochia is bright red, but turns brown and eventually yellow after a few days or weeks. You may also pass clots during the initial phase \u2014 this is completely normal as long as they are smaller than a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tm6622\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">golf ball<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But if you find that clots are larger than that or that you soak through a pad in under an hour, contact your doctor \u2014 this might mean there\u2019s another issue. Also, you shouldn\u2019t use tampons for lochia \u2014 it can introduce harmful bacteria into the vagina as well as irritate the area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaginal deliveries can cause tearing (in some cases you may have had an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/zx3823\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">episiotomy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Either of these will make your perineum (the area between your vagina and your anus) quite tender as it heals. You can use ice packs or frozen pads in your underwear to soothe the area. Upgrade your padsicles with witch hazel and aloe to help speed up healing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Postpartum body<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you may be anxious to lose your pregnancy weight, wait for your doctor or midwife\u2019s go ahead before you start exercising. Pregnancy causes significant changes in your body and beginning an exercise regime too soon after delivery can cause more problems than it solves. Counter intuitively, abdominal exercises like crunches are the most damaging and can actually worsen conditions like diastasis recti. Try not to focus on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post-pregnancy weight loss<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It took nine months to put the weight on, so give yourself at least that much time to lose it. And stay away from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/diet-and-micronutrients\/maternal-diet.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restrictive dieting if you\u2019re breastfeeding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: not only will it affect your mood and energy levels, but you need all the nutrients you can get to stay healthy and feed your baby, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving birth is physically strenuous, which means you\u2019ll want to avoid doing certain things until you\u2019re cleared by your doctor or midwife at your six-week appointment:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifting anything heavier than your baby;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crunches, sit-ups, or other abdominal exercises;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strenuous exercise;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restrictive dieting (even after your check up);<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having sex; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inserting anything into the vagina, including tampons or douches.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Breast changes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body begins producing colostrum (the first thick, nutrient-dense milk newborns eat) before your baby is even born. Colostrum becomes milk three to five days after delivery, and your breasts will feel more full as your milk comes in. You may sometimes feel engorged as your postpartum body figures out how much milk your baby actually needs. While engorgement usually gets better on its own after a day or two, it can be quite painful while it lasts. Ice packs and ibuprofen can help, as can applying heat and hand expressing some milk to relieve the pressure. But be warned \u2014 your body will replace any expressed milk. So pumping or expressing milk can ultimately prolong engorgement. And prolonged engorgement can lead to clogs and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/mastitis-dont-let-it-ruin-your-breastfeeding-journey\/\">mastitis<\/a>, which can be extremely painful. For more info on common breastfeeding issues, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/pain-during-breastfeeding-and-other-common-problems\/\">our blog<\/a> on the topic<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Mood changes and postpartum depression<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your hormones will fluctuate in the days after you give birth. These fluctuations kick off a number of physical changes from getting your uterus to contract and shrink to producing breast milk for your baby. They can also affect your mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There isn\u2019t one single <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cause<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but the physical and hormonal changes along with sleep deprivation and the intense feelings that come with having a baby, can trigger<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Postpartum depression is similar to regular depression, but the feelings tend to center around being a parent and concern for your newborn. Postpartum depression can strike anytime within the first year after your baby is born. Symptoms of postpartum depression can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Severe anger and irritability<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bouts of crying\/feelings of extreme sadness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty or lack of bonding with child<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brain fog, difficulty concentrating, or thinking clearly<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feelings of hopelessness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feelings of inadequacy as a parent<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoughts of self-harm or suicide<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoughts of harming your baby<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many new moms experience \u201cthe baby blues,\u201d a period of emotional intensity in the weeks following the birth of their child. This is totally normal, and can include feeling more teary, angry, irritable, or sensitive than usual. Unlike postpartum depression though, the baby blues usually resolves within a few weeks. If these feelings don\u2019t go away within a few months, it may be postpartum depression. Without intervention, symptoms of postpartum depression can become more severe and recur chronically. Getting <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can include <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">counselling<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, medication, and support from family and friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The long-term outlook<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term effects of pregnancy on the body<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are varied and even weird. Everything from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/insights.ovid.com\/crossref?an=00002060-201303000-00006\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bigger feet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to increased hair shedding (which is temporary, thank goodness). If you delivered your baby preterm (before 37 weeks), long-term effects also mean you\u2019re at greater risk of heart problems. Your pelvic floor can also suffer long-term consequences, which can lead to urinary incontinence and pain during sex. But the long-term effects of pregnancy aren\u2019t all bad: if you breastfeed, for every 12 months you nurse your baby, you cut your risk of developing breast cancer by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6069526\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And each full-term pregnancy that a woman carries <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/about-cancer\/causes-prevention\/risk\/hormones\/reproductive-history-fact-sheet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduces her risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of developing ovarian and endometrial cancer. Plus, there are pelvic floor physiotherapists and interventions for many issues that crop up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a baby puts your body through a lot! You grow another human being <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inside your body<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, deliver it, and make food for it. And you do most of that on little to no sleep. Your body works overtime to do this, and how you care for your postpartum body <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should reflect that. So let those dishes pile up and feel free to leave those emails unanswered for a while. Having a baby is hard work, your first priority is taking care of them and yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your baby isn\u2019t the only lasting legacy from your pregnancy.
