On top of that, breast milk meets your baby\u2019s nutritional needs no matter what you eat (well, almost). So there\u2019s no need to worry that your sweet tooth or your double cheeseburger habit will leave your little one nutritionally deficient. Despite that, there are still a few reasons to follow a breastfeeding diet plan, here\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Feeding yourself<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nursing mothers don\u2019t have to eat a balanced diet for their breastmilk to be nutritionally complete. With a few notable exceptions (more on these later), your body can draw from your own reserves to make sure your baby gets complete nutrition \u2014 by taking calcium from your bones, for example. The main reason to follow a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding diet plan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to make sure mom has enough nutrients to maintain her own good health. This means that your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list of foods to eat while breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shouldn\u2019t be restrictive. Instead, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meals and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">snacks<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should incorporate a wide variety of foods, like proteins, fruits and vegetables, dairy, grains and healthy fats like nuts. But no matter what you eat, if you\u2019re breastfeeding make sure to add a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca\/home\/articles\/vitamin-d-supplements-breastfeeding-babies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vitamin D<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> supplement to baby\u2019s diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Breastfeeding while vegan or vegetarian<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting together a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">menu<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding diet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shouldn\u2019t be stressful, but there are a few additional concerns if you are vegan or vegetarian. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK534419\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamin B12<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a crucial nutrient, and infants who don\u2019t get enough of it are at higher risk of anemia, hair and skin issues, and developmental delays. Infants receive vitamin B12 through their mother\u2019s breast milk so if a nursing mom is deficient in vitamin B12, her breastfed infant will be as well. Since vitamin B12 is almost exclusively found in animal products, vegan and vegetarian mothers who are breastfeeding should speak with their doctor about supplementing their diets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moms who have previously had <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/getting-gastric-bypass-surgery\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gastric bypass surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should also speak to their doctors as they may have difficulty absorbing necessary nutrients from their food. Their doctors may want to monitor them to ensure <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/diet-and-micronutrients\/vitamin-b12.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adequate levels of several vitamins<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and minerals including iron, vitamin B12 and calcium.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Dieting and weight loss<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As unbelievable as it sounds, breastfeeding women need about the same number of calories as pregnant women. Yes, you read that right: producing breast milk takes about the same amount of energy as growing a baby. The average woman should add between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/publications\/food-nutrition\/prenatal-nutrition-guidelines-health-professionals-background-canada-food-guide-2009.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">340 to 450 calories<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a day to her diet in the last two trimesters of her pregnancy. Once breastfeeding, this same woman requires about 300 to 400 more calories a day than her pre-pregnancy diet. If you\u2019re looking to take off a substantial amount of baby weight, however, speak to your doctor about what your daily caloric intake should be. In many cases your body can draw on the fat reserves it laid down during pregnancy to fuel breastmilk production, meaning you\u2019ll end up feeding your baby while losing weight. But cut your calories too much and you risk decreasing your milk supply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that if you\u2019re nursing twins (yes, it can be done), or if you\u2019re breastfeeding while pregnant, your caloric needs will obviously be higher. In both of these cases you should speak with your doctor to make sure you\u2019re taking in the appropriate vitamins and nutrients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Foods to avoid while breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite what the internet says, there aren\u2019t too many foods you need to cut out of your diet while breastfeeding. While you may have heard a lot about food intolerances causing upset in breastfed babies, this is pretty rare. Caffeine and dairy are the likeliest culprits when it comes to irritating your little one\u2019s stomach. But there\u2019s no need to cut them out unless you notice an increase in your baby\u2019s irritability around their consumption.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing you do have to watch for, however, is mercury. Mercury transfers to breast milk and can impact a nursing baby\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/mercury-and-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brain development<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Large fish like mackerel and bigeye tuna are well-known as mercury-rich foods, so it\u2019s best to stay away from them entirely. Check out the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/food\/consumers\/advice-about-eating-fish\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FDA\u2019s guide to eating fish<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more specific information on other species.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can I still have coffee if I\u2019m nursing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The short answer is yes. Your body can take liquid from anything you drink <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> coffee, water and even diet cola. And unlike what you\u2019ve likely been told, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19774754\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diuretic effects of caffeine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are limited so you don\u2019t really have to worry about it making you dehydrated. But caffeine does show up in breastmilk, and can take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lllc.ca\/thursday-tip-breastfeeding-and-caffeine\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your baby to fully process. So while there\u2019s no need to cut out caffeine completely, limit yourself to a couple of cups a day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One drink you don\u2019t need to limit while breastfeeding is water. Breastfeeding can quickly dehydrate you and will likely make you way thirstier than usual. Because your bowels need water to function optimally, this often means that breastfeeding and constipation go hand-in-hand. Make sure you\u2019re getting enough fibrous foods like fruits and veggies to counteract this. A fiber supplement can also help. But be warned: increasing fiber without upping your water consumption will make you constipated as well. So make sure you\u2019re getting a minimum of 8-10 glasses of water a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What can I eat to increase my milk supply?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milk supply is often a concern for breastfeeding moms. While there\u2019s no <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diet plan for breastfeeding mothers to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> follow <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to increase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">milk<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> supply, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadianbreastfeedingfoundation.org\/induced\/herbs.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Canadian Breastfeeding Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says there is some evidence that the herbs fenugreek and blessed thistle may help boost milk production. There are tons of recipes and products that incorporate these herbs, from cookies to teas. No supplements are without risk, however, so speak to your doctor first to rule out any adverse reactions or medication interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re concerned that your milk supply is keeping your little one from gaining enough weight, it\u2019s crucial you speak with your child\u2019s doctor. They may recommend supplementing with formula or, if your baby is a little older, adding certain foods to your baby\u2019s diet. Unfortunately there are no <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> moms can <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eat while breastfeeding to help your baby gain weight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking care of yourself and meeting your nutritional needs with an infant is easier said than done. While you might have enough time to prepare food while your baby sleeps, it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed they\u2019ll wake up before you have time to eat it. Unless you have help or give up sleeping entirely, it\u2019s hard to stick to a diet or nutritional plan. But try your best and make sure to keep taking your prenatal vitamins &#8211; it\u2019ll all be over before you know it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breastfeeding has a ton of pros: it\u2019s free, portable, and convenient \u2014 no washing or sterilizing bottles involved!
