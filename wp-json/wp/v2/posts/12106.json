The curve once got to a promising low, but health officials are warning that we\u2019re not out of the woods yet. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/canada-covid-19-second-wave-1.5507522\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second wave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of infections in the fall and winter is looking more and more likely. If you\u2019re more at risk of getting sick, how should you prepare yourself? It&#8217;s helpful to plan for all possible outcomes, including getting sick with COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Am I going to get really sick?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might, but it\u2019s more likely that you won\u2019t. Only a small number of people who get COVID-19 end up at the hospital. The rest have mild or moderate flu-like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/symptoms.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a large number are completely asymptomatic. But because the novel coronavirus spreads so easily, if you have symptoms or have been in contact with someone who\u2019s tested positive for COVID-19, you must self-isolate. You&#8217;ll need a two-week supply of food at home, as well as adequate stockpiles of toilet paper. Here\u2019s what you should consider about your at-home quarantine provisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Make sure you have the right food for getting sick<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soup is both comforting and hydrating, two things we tend to want when we\u2019re sick. Since canned or instant soup is cheap and lasts forever, it\u2019s not a bad idea to have some in the cupboard. If you have kids though, consider stocking up on more than just soup. Children seem to be more likely to have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aappublications.org\/news\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus031620\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mild version<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of COVID-19 than adults. This means that the virus could cause little more than a sore throat in your little ones while keeping you in bed for two weeks. Have some heat-and-serve meals in your freezer as a backup \u2014 it\u2019s doubtful you\u2019ll want to cook dinner from scratch in that state.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Stock up on any medications you might need<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over-the-counter pain medication is a great thing to have on hand when you\u2019re feeling crummy. Both acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) are fine \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/debunking-the-covid-19-advil-scare\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ibuprofen makes COVID-19 worse<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you take prescription medication, have a small stockpile of it on-hand as well. If the amount of medication your pharmacist can give you is restricted right now, consider setting up a delivery date with your pharmacy ahead of time. That way you can \u201cset it and forget it\u201d while still making sure you have what you need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Prepare a hospital \u201cgo bag\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one wants to think that they\u2019ll be one of the worst case scenarios, but it\u2019s possible. And if you do need in-hospital treatment, you likely won\u2019t have time or energy to pack a bag. Leave your hospital bag by the door and make sure to include a change of clothes, essential toiletries, a charging cable, and your health card. Having all your personal items at the ready will make your hospital stay much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Make a plan for your loved ones<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is anyone dependent on you? If you end up in the hospital, or terribly sick at home, do you have someone to walk Fido or watch your kids? If you\u2019re breastfeeding, formula can work in a pinch. But if you have the opportunity now, it might be worthwhile to pump some extra milk for freezing. You could even put together some activity kits for your kids in case they get a mild version of COVID-19 and you end up with more intense symptoms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Make a self-quarantine plan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you only get a mild version of COVID-19, you\u2019ll still need to quarantine yourself from other members of your household. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have to share a bathroom with others, consider what a cleaning protocol would look like if anyone gets sick. While there have been stories of people <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/newfoundland-labrador\/blaine-tucker-tent-self-isolation-1.5514574\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">camping out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their driveways for lack of a place to self-isolate indoors, your plan doesn\u2019t have to be that extreme. But it\u2019s best to have an idea of what you\u2019d do before you get sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s not a pleasant thought, opening the country back up means there might be a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Hopefully you won\u2019t get it, and if you do, hopefully your symptoms will be mild. But if you do end up getting a bad case, you\u2019ll be glad you had a plan in place. If you think you might have COVID-19, talk to your doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No one wants to get COVID-19.
