In autumn and winter, harsh winds and cold temperatures create perfect conditions for dry skin. Springtime brings blooming flowers \u2014 nice to look at, but one whiff can send allergy sufferers straight to the pharmacy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of us have learned to anticipate these challenges each season. But there\u2019s one seasonal change that affects both men and women that\u2019s not often discussed, and that\u2019s seasonal hair loss. It\u2019s most common in the summer and fall months, and with a little attention, it\u2019s possible to minimize your seasonal shedding each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How much hair loss is normal?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a small amount of hair ends up in your brush when you\u2019re combing it each day, don\u2019t worry. Hair loss is a natural daily occurrence for both men and women. Losing a few strands isn\u2019t a sign you\u2019re going bald. Adults who shed a normal amount lose between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aad.org\/public\/diseases\/hair-loss\/insider\/shedding#:~:text=It's%20normal%20to%20shed%20between,this%20condition%20is%20telogen%20effluvium.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50-100<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hairs from their head each day. It\u2019s part of the cycle of hair growth, which happens in phases. The stages are growth, rest, shedding and replacement. When you shed more hair than you replace, you\u2019ll start to notice patches of thin hair.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, lack of new hair growth can leave bald areas on your head or body. This condition is known as androgenic alopecia. In men, it\u2019s also called male pattern baldness. This condition commonly affects the hairline and crown. Male pattern baldness happens in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dermatology.ca\/public-patients\/hair\/alopecia\/#:~:text=Male%20pattern%20baldness%20affects%20about,%E2%80%9Ccrown%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20scalp.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about 50%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian men by age 70. Contrary to popular belief, significant hair loss and balding happens to women too. Female pattern baldness happens to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dermatology.ca\/public-patients\/hair\/alopecia\/#:~:text=Male%20pattern%20baldness%20affects%20about,%E2%80%9Ccrown%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20scalp.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of women by age 50. Hair thinning in women usually happens near the crown of the head.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wondering whether or not baldness is your future, take a look at your family tree. Hereditary-patterned baldness is the most common form of baldness, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/a_to_z\/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z#:~:text=Hereditary%2Dpattern%20baldness%20is%20the,hair%20thinning%20as%20they%20age.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caused by<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a combination of genetics and hormonal changes as you age.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why does seasonal hair loss happen?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientists and doctors are still looking for the root cause of seasonal hair loss. While people notice more hair loss in the summer and fall seasons, we don\u2019t know exactly why it happens during those times of year. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5002231\/hair-loss-study\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers speculate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the trend is tied to human evolution. It once made sense for us shed body hair to keep cool in warm weather. Back then we had a lot more of it than we do today. Similarly, in the winter months mammals like humans grow extra thick hair or fur to protect them from the elements. That could be why we don\u2019t see as much hair loss in the wintertime in modern day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What you can do about hair loss<\/h2>\n<h3>Eat hair-friendly foods<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods that are high in protein help you grow healthy, strong hair. Hair follicles are the tube shaped passages in the scalp and skin that your hair grows from. They\u2019re made primarily of protein, which is also a key ingredient in the production of healthy hair cells. Try introducing more eggs or fish into your diet to boost your body\u2019s protein levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Minimize your stress<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress related hair loss can take a few forms. Some people gravitate towards tugging on their hair to self-soothe, which is a condition called trichotillomania.<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress also causes the body to release a hormone called cortisol, which in turn causes a surge in another hormone, testosterone. A certain subtype of testosterone called dihydrotestosterone lives in your skin and hair. When there\u2019s too much of it, the overstimulation causes hair loss. Stress management techniques like mindfulness or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\">psychotherapy<\/a> can help you keep calm in tough situations, and mitigate the consequences of constant stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Take a break from colouring and heat styling<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harsh chemicals from hair dyes and heat from blowdryers aren\u2019t good for your hair. In high-shed seasons like summer and fall, go easy on any intensive styling if you\u2019re noticing hair loss. Permanent hair dye contains ammonia which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/cancer-causes\/hair-dyes.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakens the hair shaft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Heat styling depletes your hair\u2019s natural proteins, leaving your hair dry and prone to snapping off. Natural dyes and air drying your hair are two less harmful alternatives. <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Medication<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dermatologists may recommend topical and oral medications that promote hair growth. In men, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/medications\/finasteride\/\">Finasteride<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/hair-loss-alopecia-treatment\/\">minoxidil<\/a> have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tr2559\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proven effective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and for women a top choice is minoxidil. Medication is unlikely to restore your full head of hair, but it can promote new growth that may not have otherwise occurred. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Hair transplants<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hair transplant is a surgical technique where healthy hair follicles are moved from another part of the body to the area that\u2019s balding. Transplants have more success than medications, and although the hair will still thin over time, it does provide growth in the interim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we discover more about the origins of seasonal hair loss, taking stock of when you notice increased shedding is a great preventative measure. If you know when to predict the hair loss, you can have a plan in place for those months. Whether it\u2019s diet changes or a low heat hairstyle, you\u2019ll know the time of year when you need to change your routine to maintain lush locks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hair loss can be a tough experience. If you\u2019re looking for help with preventing seasonal hair loss, book an appointment with one of our dermatologists. They\u2019ll help you sort through options available to help you look and feel your best.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you notice that you lose more hair in certain seasons of the year?
