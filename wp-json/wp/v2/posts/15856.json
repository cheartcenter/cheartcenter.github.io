It\u2019s up there on the list of life\u2019s great pleasures and it can be an incredible bonding opportunity. So when your baby loses their appetite, it\u2019s distressing, no matter what stage of life they\u2019re at. Here\u2019s how to navigate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loss of appetite in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What to do if your newborn baby isn\u2019t eating<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few reasons that a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eating<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enough \u2014 a tongue tie, illness or being born prematurely. But regardless of the reason, if your newborn isn\u2019t feeding normally, you should call their doctor, especially if your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleepy and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> loss of appetite<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This can be a sign of illness, infection or low blood sugar. Infants dehydrate easily and not eating can quickly turn into a medical issue. Generally they shouldn\u2019t go without feeding for longer than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/feednewborn.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five hours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for their first 12 weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Loss of appetite in baby\u2019s first year<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your baby will likely <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/Article?contentid=482&amp;language=English\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double their birth weight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their first four months. By the time they hit one, they\u2019ll probably have tripled it. You\u2019ve no doubt heard about growth spurts \u2014 periods of time where babies grow more rapidly and noticeably than other times. To facilitate all that growth, they\u2019ve got to drink a lot of milk, or take in a lot of formula. But when that growth spurt ends, their appetite often falls off for a little while. We often see this temporary <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loss of appetite<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four-month-old babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because they\u2019ve just come off of a growth spurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loss of appetite in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two months<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might also be because of a lull in growth, but it\u2019s more likely due to a change in the composition of your breastmilk. Until about six weeks, your breast milk contains colostrum, which has a laxative effect on baby. As the amount of colostrum diminishes, your baby\u2019s food goes through them less rapidly, which can trigger a decrease in appetite (as well as the number of poopy diapers you deal with).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Teething and loss of appetite<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/welcoming-babys-first-teeth\/\">Babies\u2019 first teeth<\/a> usually come in at about six months. The last of their baby teeth, the molars, appear around age two. So the loss of appetite in babies and toddlers which teething often causes, can strike pretty much any time within their first two years. Luckily, the effects of teething don\u2019t typically last longer than a few days per tooth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Loss of appetite in toddlers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your three-year-old might eat as much as a full grown adult sometimes, but a cookie is still big enough to take the edge off her hunger. While the end of a growth spurt could be the culprit, if your toddler is suddenly eating less at mealtimes, find out if they&#8217;re snacking throughout the day. A granola bar or a handful of veggie chips won\u2019t fill us up, but your toddler\u2019s stomach is much smaller. Keep food to mealtime as much as possible or get used to trotting out dinner again just before bedtime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While loss of appetite is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usually<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nothing to worry about, it can sometimes mean your child is sick \u2014 especially if they have other symptoms. If your toddler has both diarrhea and loss of appetite, for example, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve come down with stomach flu \u2014 whether they have a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vomiting toddler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loss of appetite and diarrhea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely has gastroenteritis or the stomach flu. You can usually treat these conditions at home provided you monitor your child for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/article?contentid=776&amp;language=english\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signs of dehydration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to increase an infant\u2019s appetite<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newborns have tiny stomachs so they can only take in a little bit of food at each feed. This means they need to eat every two to three hours, or a minimum of eight times a day. For their first few weeks of\u00a0 life, it seems like they&#8217;re constantly at your breast or wanting their bottle. It\u2019s a lot of work, but as your baby grows, their stomach will too, and the amount of food they take at each feeding will increase. As much as you may want to boost your child\u2019s appetite, the only safe way to do it is to wait. There are no <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vitamins for babies to increase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appetite<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example. And you should never force feed your child, or add cereal to their bottle (despite what your mother-in-law tells you). An infant\u2019s digestive system isn\u2019t ready for anything other than breastmilk or formula until around four to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/te4473\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Introducing it sooner can put them at risk for nutritional deficiencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As upsetting as it can be, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loss of appetite in babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is common and you can usually trust that your baby\u2019s body knows what it needs. As long as your baby is otherwise healthy and growing normally it\u2019s probably nothing to worry about. Keep offering and eventually they\u2019ll start taking it. And as always, speak to a doctor or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/pediatrics\/\">pediatrician<\/a> if you\u2019re concerned.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Feeding is a huge part of parenting \u2014 you give them a bottle to stop crying, nurse when they\u2019re sick, and have a great time exploring different foods when they get big enough.
