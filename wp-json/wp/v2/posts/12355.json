The temptation is strong to head outside, get a fresh haircut, and enjoy socializing on a patio. Now that provincial governments are rolling out their reopening plans, normal life is starting to feel within reach once again.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to take caution \u2014 experts are saying that \u201cnormal\u201d might not be realistic for a long, long time. From here on out, we\u2019ll be living in a post-pandemic world. Until a vaccine is found, we\u2019ll have to be aware of potentially exposing ourselves to the COVID-19 virus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key is to listen to your province\u2019s official guidelines. Some provinces, like New Brunswick and Manitoba, haven\u2019t seen many cases of infection and are reopening businesses earlier. Provinces like Quebec and Ontario, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/news\/a-heat-map-of-coronavirus-cases-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which have been the national hotspots<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will likely have stricter guidelines for residents to follow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why we still need to be cautious<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we need to keep being careful, even though things are reopening? There might be a second wave of COVID-19. We\u2019ve done a good job of flattening the curve, but our hard work could be undone if we start mingling again too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep these guidelines in mind as we prepare to cautiously go back to normal:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The medically vulnerable should still shelter in place. Until the virus is eradicated, they\u2019ll be at high risk of developing serious complications.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritize societal benefit. Which outings qualify as \u201cwants,\u201d and which are \u201cneeds\u201d?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare to revert back to restrictions again. If we reopen parks and businesses, and suddenly there\u2019s a spike in COVID-19 cases, we\u2019ll likely need to resume sheltering in place.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherwise, it\u2019s alright to be tentatively excited! Read on for predictions and recommendations on different aspects of post-quarantine life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Your job<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers are currently planning how to bring staff back to the office. For many businesses, this will mean bringing people back in waves. You might find you get called back to the office for just one day a week, or for one week out of the month. Desks will likely be placed further apart, and plexiglass dividers may be installed. Cleaning is also likely to be ramped up, with high-traffic areas like entryways, bathrooms and kitchens getting near-constant attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your office will probably have new policies in place surrounding COVID-19, which will be worth a read to protect yourself. Try to wash your hands very often while at work, and wear a mask.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions about how your employer is handling staff safety, be sure to reach out to your manager or HR department. They have a responsibility to clearly broadcast safety measures so that everyone feels secure coming back to a shared space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Transportation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The safest way to travel, in terms of COVID-19, is by car. It doesn\u2019t present any higher risk than simply being at home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public transit will be much riskier. Make sure that you follow hygiene steps like washing your hands before and after your trip, wearing a mask, and keeping six feet apart from other travellers. If possible, travel outside of daily rush hours to minimize the number of people you come in contact with.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re commuting locally, why not try bicycling? That way you avoid being in close, confined quarters with other people. If you\u2019re renting a city bike, bring disinfectant wipes to pass over the bike\u2019s handlebars and seat before you set off.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Travel<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer, you might want to stick to discovering the beautiful sights of Canada. The Canadian government is currently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/travel.gc.ca\/travelling\/advisories\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommending against non-essential travel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to most countries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When will you have the green light to travel abroad again? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/travel\/advice\/2020\/04\/03\/life-after-coronavirus-when-we-know-its-safe-travel-again\/5105038002\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some clues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to know you\u2019re travelling safely:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schools have reopened.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A travel agent is willing to book a trip for you \u2014 their business depends on your safety.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An insurance company will grant you a travel insurance policy.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it stands now, countries are in different stages of controlling the virus and reopening their public spaces. Travelling internationally would be a big risk for a second wave of COVID-19. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.airport-technology.com\/features\/the-travel-bug-preventing-the-spread-of-disease-at-airports\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airports are a major hub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for disease transmission.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Entertainment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we can\u2019t travel to Europe, at least we should be able to have fun this summer! The good news is that restaurants are beginning to reopen. Patio lounging is looking like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/6929866\/coronavirus-restaurants-safety\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very safe summer activity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as long as you\u2019re following the guidelines set out by your local authorities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your restaurant experience will be very different the first time you go back. For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/assets\/documents\/covid-19-relaunch-guidance-restaurants.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alberta requires<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that restaurants only fill their dining rooms to 50% occupancy. Servers may have to wear N95 masks, and customers are advised to wear masks as well. Music will be kept at a low volume so that people don\u2019t have to lean in close to hear each other.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about concerts and sports matches? Unfortunately, any event with packed crowds will likely be put off until 2021. On the upside, there\u2019s been a rise of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/british-columbia\/drive-in-concert-b-c-1.5581259\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drive-in events<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Mental health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been a tough year so far, to say the very least. Getting laid off has been traumatic for some of us, while other people have had to quickly transition to working productively from home. All the while, a pandemic has totally robbed us of normal life. There\u2019s a lot to be stressed about.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to keep making time for yourself, even while in quarantine. Cook healthy meals, take a yoga or meditation class, and connect with friends virtually. These will help keep your body and mind happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s understandable that the usual coping strategies might not be cutting it during these exceptional circumstances. If that\u2019s the case, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talking to an online therapist can help<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If there\u2019s ever been a time to seek mental health advice, this is it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Salons and personal grooming<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now, you might have picked up the skills to become a hairdresser yourself. But if you\u2019re itching to get trimmed or shaved by a professional, you\u2019re in luck. Many salons have already reopened in Canada. But, don\u2019t expect the same old treatment when you go for an appointment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/6928644\/hair-salon-barber-shop-safe\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hairdressers are advised to wear N95 masks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and clients are recommended to wear non-medical masks when possible during their service. Salon staff will need to be highly trained on how to protect themselves and maintain an extra clean environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Going to the gym<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of us are pumped to go pump some iron, but gyms will be one of the trickiest businesses to reopen. They see a high amount of human traffic, and patrons touch several machines and equipment items during their workout.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto gym Sweat and Tonic recently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sweatandtonic.com\/updates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released their plans to reopen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even though they don\u2019t have a date yet. The plans include replacing the gym\u2019s ventilation with a hospital grade system, disinfecting frequently, and only holding classes at 50% normal occupancy. So, expect it to be difficult to book a class or workout slot at your favourite gym.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many gyms are offering virtual fitness classes in the meantime. These are a great option to stay safe at home while still getting your sweat on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If anything, this pandemic has inspired lots of Canadians to become more self-sufficient at home. We\u2019re building home offices, investing in gym equipment, learning new recipes, and cutting our own bangs. It\u2019s best to continue on this track \u2014 we need to reopen society cautiously, with minimal crowds, and be prepared to go back to sheltering in place if needed. We\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though \u201cnormal\u201d might not be a reality for quite some time, we can enjoy the simple pleasures once again as we come out of quarantine. Gathering in small groups, wearing masks, and washing our hands will help keep COVID-19 on the decline. Let\u2019s enjoy summer while it\u2019s here, a peculiar summer it may be. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Experts are saying that \u201cnormal\u201d might not be realistic for a long, long time.
