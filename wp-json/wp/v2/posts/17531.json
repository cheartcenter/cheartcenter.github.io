It\u2019s a major victory for the scientific community, and for everyday Canadians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, the vaccine is only one piece of the puzzle. There will be other challenges before we can finally say we\u2019ve overcome COVID-19. Here\u2019s an idea of what those are, and how they\u2019ll shape life for the foreseeable future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccine rollout times will impact how fast we return to normal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The speed at which populations receive the vaccine will influence how soon the pandemic ends. The timeline will rely on our stockpiles of vaccines. Pharmaceutical companies can only make so many doses of a particular vaccine at once. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/politics\/vaccine-rollout-plan-phac-1.5833912\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first vaccine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Canada is by Pfizer, but there are other pharmaceutical companies working on vaccines too. Once they\u2019re approved by Health Canada they\u2019ll be distributed, increasing the total number of COVID-19 vaccines we have in-stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccinations will be given in priority order<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who are most at risk of developing severe health complications from COVID-19 will be vaccinated first.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to deciding which populations need to be vaccinated urgently, provinces will use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/immunization\/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci\/guidance-prioritization-initial-doses-covid-19-vaccines.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suggestions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. The following population groups will likely be vaccinated first.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-term care home staff and residents\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elderly folks are especially susceptible to the worst effects of COVID-19. To prevent COVID-19 from spreading through long-term care homes, vaccinating residents and staff is a top priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Older adults\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of long-term care facilities, adults over 80 years old are the highest priority population, followed by adults 70 years of age and older. These groups are at high risk of needing hospitalization if they get sick. Minimizing the spread in older adults will help reduce patient volumes, and ease the burden on our hospitals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care workers\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes medical professionals, hospital staff, and personal support workers who visit patients\u2019 homes. It will also include the health care providers who will eventually administer the vaccines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indigenous communities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adults in remote Indigenous communities have less access to medical care. This means a COVID-19 outbreak would have disproportionate consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next phase of vaccinations will go to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any medical personnel not covered by the first batch of vaccines.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who live in very close quarters with other people. This group includes migrant workers, people in homeless shelters, and people in correctional facilities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essential workers who can&#8217;t work from home or socially distanced environments. Grocery store staff and public transit operators are examples of essential workers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After these two phases of vaccination, doses will be available to everyone else. The speed at which vaccines are approved and administered will determine how long these phases last.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more people vaccinated, the faster we stop COVID-19<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vaccine can only be effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19 if people choose to get it. Exactly how many people need to be vaccinated to wipe the virus out is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/q-a-detail\/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19#:~:text=We%20are%20still%20learning%20about,people%20to%20get%20infected.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still unknown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Evidence from other pandemics suggests if about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/back-to-normal-by-spring-are-we-expecting-too-much-from-the-first-covid-19-vaccines-149342\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the population is immune, a disease slows down or is eradicated completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long vaccinations last is still an open question<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes vaccines require more than one dose to take effect. With some COVID-19 vaccines, you\u2019ll need to get <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/health\/coronavirus\/from-booster-shots-to-side-effects-your-covid-19-vaccine-questions-answered-1.5211849\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two shots<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be fully vaccinated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the initial dosage \u2014 whether it\u2019s one or two shots \u2014 some vaccines require booster shots to ensure your system has built up immunity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sticking to public health guidelines is still important<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public health guidelines are still incredibly important, even with a vaccine in sight. As vaccines roll out, continuing to socially distance, wear masks, and use hand sanitizer will keep the number of new cases low. If we\u2019re able to slow the spread in communities that aren\u2019t yet vaccinated, we\u2019ll get back to normal much faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When will we return to work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/carlieporterfield\/2020\/11\/15\/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus\/?sh=7cff543d36ed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for when we\u2019ll be able to safely return to our office desks is spring or summer of 2021. It will heavily depend on how many people receive their vaccination, how fast vaccines work, and a continued effort to stop the spread.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mass gatherings like conferences or sporting events could be on hold for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/08\/04\/canada-vaccine-doctors-silver-bullet-391445\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, small scale socializing could be back on the agenda much sooner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life after the pandemic will undoubtedly be different from life pre-2020. But, the prospects are bright. A vaccine is a major victory and a great reason to be optimistic. Until COVID-19 is fully behind us, continue wearing masks, washing your hands frequently, and practising physical distancing. If you need medical help, you can see our doctors from the comfort of your home over your smartphone, tablet, or computer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re all excited to hear that a COVID-19 vaccine has been approved in Canada.
