Dietitians are a fantastic resource you can leverage when you\u2019re trying to lose weight. They work with you to create realistic plans and set achievable goals. They\u2019ll also help you find solutions to obstacles you hit along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of a dietitian isn\u2019t to give you easy answers. There are no easy answers for weight loss. A dietitian\u2019s goal is to help you better understand how to make intelligent choices regarding your diet, which will ultimately have a positive impact on your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We make it simple to meet with a dietitian. All you have to do is schedule a visit on our platform so you can get started right away.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Personalized tips and tricks<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a bad food-related habit you\u2019d like to break? A dietitian can help you find reasonable solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you drink a lot of soft drinks every day, a dietitian may suggest cutting back to a single cup per day. Are you a huge fan of pizza? You can still enjoy weekly pizza night if you start ordering more vegetable toppings, less fatty meats, and skip the extra cheese.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all have foods we love that aren\u2019t necessarily great for our diets, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to cut them out completely. A dietitian will work with you to identify food habits that could be hindering your weight loss plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve determined some foods that could be stumbling blocks for you, you can find healthier ways to build them into your diet. This way, you don\u2019t have to remove them completely. By scheduling them into your meal plan, you can better control the volume you consume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not always about removing things completely from your diet. Instead, it\u2019s about finding ways to enjoy them in moderation, so they don\u2019t negatively impact your weight loss strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Building a diet plan<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from controlling how many \u201ccheat\u201d foods we consume, a dietitian will work with you to create a realistic diet plan for you to follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This involves understanding all the factors that go into your body\u2019s daily maintenance calories. These are the calories that your body requires each day to maintain your energy levels, while you go about your daily tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of calories we require varies widely from person to person. It\u2019s calculated based on sex, age, weight, height, and the volume of physical activities you perform each day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your personalized diet plan will take all those factors into account. It can help you create a meal-planning system that promotes healthy, well-rounded eating habits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best of all, your diet plan does this without forcing you to starve yourself or avoid your favourite foods entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Setting achievable goals<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to aim for the stars when you\u2019re first starting your weight loss journey, but that may not be the most effective way to set goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you aim too high, you make it virtually impossible to reach those goals. When you don\u2019t see the improvement you\u2019d hoped for, it can be demoralizing and demotivating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it\u2019s done in a healthy way, weight loss is a slow and steady process. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and it can take months or years to achieve the goals you set out for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dietitian is going to help you set achievable goals that will be much more realistic to meet, and at shorter intervals. This way, you can pause throughout your journey to acknowledge the small improvements you\u2019ve made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small improvements add up. If you stick to the plan the dietitian sets out for you, eventually you\u2019ll be standing in front of the mirror wondering how you\u2019ve come so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Breaking through weight loss barriers<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One obstacle many people avoid discussing when it comes to weight loss is reaching a plateau.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At different points during your weight loss journey, you will likely reach points when your weight loss starts to slow down. The things you were doing before may not work as well anymore, and this could require you to reevaluate your current plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is normal. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not working hard enough, and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that the plan isn\u2019t working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you lose weight, your body will begin to adjust to the things you\u2019re doing, meaning the same efforts may not have the same results. Also, as you begin to shed weight and adjust your regular diet, your body\u2019s maintenance calories go down. This means that your entire plan may need to be adjusted every few months to account for these changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t panic if you find yourself plateauing. Talk to your dietitian. They\u2019ll be able to make suggestions to help you break through these barriers and continue onto the next steps in your weight loss journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Creating a healthy long-term relationship with food<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight loss is only really helpful if it\u2019s sustainable. You may shed a few pounds in a few months, but if you go back to your bad eating habits, you\u2019ll gain them right back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with a dietitian isn\u2019t about finding short-term solutions. It\u2019s about building a healthier, more well-balanced long-term relationship with food. Maintaining good habits means when you lose weight, you\u2019re able to keep it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to manage your food choices and training yourself to maintain healthy eating habits indefinitely are the real benefits of working with a dietitian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight loss is simply a positive consequence of healthier, more well-rounded eating habits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Can Maple connect me with a dietitian online?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes!
