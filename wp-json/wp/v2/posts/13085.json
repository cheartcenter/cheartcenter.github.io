Like anything else worthwhile, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building strong relationships<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> requires lots of continuous work. And, no matter what you do, every relationship still has good days and bad days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since every bond is unique, there\u2019s no single formula for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to build healthy relationships.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But, there are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship guidelines <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that you and your partner can adapt and make your own. Here are a few <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategies to maintain healthy relationships<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you can use as a starting point<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Communicate consistently<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication and relationship building<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are one in the same. Especially during the early phase of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">developing a relationship<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sometimes called the honeymoon phase, it\u2019s important to develop a practice of open communication about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likes and dislikes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Values<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotions, thoughts, and feelings<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication can be verbal and nonverbal. Verbal communication means talking about your thoughts and feelings out loud. During nonverbal communication, you use cues to show that you\u2019re listening and engaged. This includes body language cues like nodding or eye contact. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/HealthyLiving\/relationships-and-communication\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to pay attention to both to communicate effectively.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, both you and your partner will change and grow during your time together. That\u2019s where communication comes in as one of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keys to maintaining a healthy relationship.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Communication helps you stay engaged with your partner, and better understand their evolution as a person from the day you met until now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice intimacy<\/h2>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When most of us think about intimacy, sex is the first thing that comes to mind. But intimacy comes in many different forms, and exploring them is a great <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way to improve your relationship.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The most common types of intimacy are:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotional intimacy \u2014<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this occurs when you and your partner are comfortable sharing personal inner feelings. It\u2019s when you can both be vulnerable with one another without fearing judgment. Couples with strong emotional intimacy feel secure in each other\u2019s presence, and that leads to open conversations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Intellectual intimacy\u00a0 \u2014 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this is when you and your partner form a connection over exchanging ideas. A couple achieves intellectual intimacy through finding something that both partners are passionate about, like music or food. When this type of intimacy is nourished, the exchanges and conversation it creates enhances a couple\u2019s quality time.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Physical intimacy\u00a0 \u2014 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this can include sexual contact, though it doesn\u2019t automatically include sex. There are lots of ways to be physically intimate, like holding hands, hugging, or cuddling. <\/span><\/li>\n<li>Spiritual intimacy\u00a0 \u2014 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happens in a relationship when partners share awe-inspiring moments together. It\u2019s possible to have moments of spiritual intimacy even if you and your partner aren\u2019t religious. Sharing moments of beauty, like watching a sunrise or getting into nature, can build a bond that makes you feel uniquely connected to your partner. That\u2019s because you\u2019ve experienced something beautiful together that speaks to a deeper, non-logical part of you both.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Learn to disagree in a healthy way<\/h2>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disagreements aren\u2019t necessarily a sign of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship problems.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In fact, learning to have constructive disagreements should be on your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthy relationships checklist.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Either partner should feel comfortable expressing when they\u2019re upset.<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2012\/08\/120802133649.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies show that short-term disagreements can help longer term relationships.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Small conflicts stop grievances with a partner from building up into something bigger over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a partnership, conflict is inevitable. Learning to express disagreement respectfully is a crucial <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship building skill.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Aim to create a space where you and your partner feel safe expressing your feelings \u2014 even the unpopular ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Have your own hobbies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, having solo interests can actually <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strengthen your relationship.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You don\u2019t have to do everything together to have a healthy bond.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/lib\/symptoms-of-codependency\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codependency is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a type of unhealthy relationship<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where one partner relies on the other for emotional fulfillment. This can create a power imbalance, where one person has too much control over the other person\u2019s happiness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why one of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">things that makes a good relationship<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is having personal interests that you and your partner enjoy separately. It\u2019s a way for you both to have sources of personal validation outside of the relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Invest in self care<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romantic or otherwise, it\u2019s hard to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">build personal relationships<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that are healthy if you\u2019re having trouble with your self-esteem.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/ca\/basics\/self-esteem\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> People with high self-esteem are more likely to be confident in themselves, and build strong relationships with others.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The good thing is that self-esteem is something you can strengthen. With the right support, you can build it over time like a muscle. The key to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">understanding relationships<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> begins with understanding and loving ourselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teps to building a healthy relationship<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> look different for everyone, but these fundamentals are a great place to start. As you grow, you\u2019ll pick up <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship tips and advice <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">along the way. Some will work for you, and some won\u2019t. And that\u2019s okay! With honest effort, you and your partner will find new ways to support one another and strengthen your bond as days go by.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationship advice for couples<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that\u2019s specific to you and your partner, you can connect with one of our therapists online.
