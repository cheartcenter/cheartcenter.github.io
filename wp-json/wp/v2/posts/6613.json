While this has deepened awareness of celiac disease for some people, others roll their eyes at what they see as just another dietary fad. But the symptoms of celiac disease have real consequences for those who suffer from it. And some have taken it as a sign that we should all be avoiding gluten. Let&#8217;s dispel some of the myths surrounding this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is celiac disease?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Celiac disease is just part of a new fad diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: Celiac disease (or CD) is an autoimmune condition that affects the intestines. For those of us with CD, ingesting gluten damages small, finger-like structures that line the intestines called \u201cvilli.\u201d Villi are crucial to our digestion, and when they&#8217;re damaged, we can\u2019t properly absorb nutrients from our food. This can lead to malnutrition, osteoporosis and all sorts of other bad things. By some estimates, about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.celiac.ca\/gluten-related-disorders\/celiac-disease\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of us have celiac disease worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is gluten?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Gluten is a made up substance to scare us off from eating bread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: Gluten is a substance found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. It\u2019s a combination of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/science\/health-and-medicine\/gastrointestinal-system-diseases\/celiac-disease\/v\/what-is-gluten\">two proteins<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is the reason that dough is elastic and sticky (which is why gluten-free baked goods are usually crumbly).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Causes of celiac disease<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: You can get celiac disease from eating too much gluten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: Celiac disease has a hereditary component in some cases, and you have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/celiac.org\/about-celiac-disease\/what-is-celiac-disease\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in 10<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chance of developing it if you have a sibling or parent with the disease. In other cases, external factors bring it on. Some evidence suggests that introducing gluten into a child\u2019s diet before <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/coeliac-disease\/causes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three months of age<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or not breastfeeding them when gluten is introduced, can increase their risk. In yet other cases, certain intestinal infections at a young age can cause the onset of CD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For certain individuals, celiac disease develops much later in life. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/celiac-disease\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20352220\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these cases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it can be brought on by major life events such as pregnancy, childbirth, or surgery. In other instances, viral infections in the gut can cause it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Celiac disease symptoms in adults<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: It\u2019s easy to identify the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celiac disease<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: There are basically three categories when it comes to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celiac disease<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first includes those you would suspect from a disease that targets the digestive system: gas, bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second category is more diffuse and can be downright mysterious: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/ency\/article\/001480.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin irritations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, anemia, joint pain, infertility and depression.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third category includes people who may have no external symptoms at all. Falling into this group is perhaps the most dangerous, since untreated celiac disease can increase the risk for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2660494\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certain types of cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In some instances it can even be fatal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Celiac disease symptoms in children<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Celiac disease isn&#8217;t that severe in children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: Diagnosis of CD in children rarely happens before the age of six months, as most don\u2019t begin to\u00a0consume solid food (and therefore gluten) before then. Classic symptoms present as they do in adults, with diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and lack of appetite. But because CD disables the body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients from food, impaired growth is often a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptom in children. Celiac disease<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affects <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">behaviour<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0as well, with children expressing irritability, depression and anxiety. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/139\/3\/e20162848\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep and behavioural issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0were also reported by mothers of children with untreated celiac disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is celiac disease screening?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: There\u2019s no test to conclusively diagnose celiac disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnosing celiac disease<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to involve taking a history of patient symptoms. Thankfully, a simple <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blood test<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celiac disease<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> screening today. Although this procedure usually suffices, in some cases doctors may follow up with a biopsy of the small intestine. The catch is that in both of these\u00a0cases, your diet must still include gluten for them to work. So there\u2019s usually no benefit to removing it until you\u2019ve been to the doctor. The blood test measures \u201cTissue Transglutaminase IgA,\u201d which is the antibody your body produces in response to gluten if you have CD. If you\u2019ve gone off gluten already, there will be no response to measure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are celiac disease and gluten intolerance the same thing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Being sensitive to gluten means you have celiac disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some individuals without CD report celiac-like symptoms that disappear when they eliminate gluten from their diets. This is called non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and includes symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, skin rashes, brain fog, acid reflux and even joint pain. The tricky part is that gluten doesn\u2019t damage the small intestines for those with NCGS like it does for those with CD. This means the regular CD screening tools don\u2019t work if you have NCGS. On top of that, several recent studies have called into question whether NCGS is a true \u201cstate of illness.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the jury is still out on NCGS, it\u2019s crucial, for anyone showing these symptoms to be screened for celiac disease before eliminating gluten from their diet, in order\u00a0to rule it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: If you have celiac disease you can indulge in &#8220;cheat days&#8221; on special occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth: There are no special exceptions for birthday parties or your friend\u2019s home-brewed beer. For those with CD, even a small amount of gluten can damage the intestines. And each time you ingest gluten, the body has to start the healing process over again. The body can be so sensitive, that even cross-contamination of foods can cause problems \u2014 when buying unpackaged bulk food, for example. The only way to treat celiac disease is by completely\u00a0eliminating gluten from your diet, and doing so for your entire life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there\u2019s no doubt that many have recently jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon, those with celiac disease are suffering from a real illness. For the rest of us, a gluten-free diet may seem healthier in some ways because it usually avoids processed and carb-heavy foods. But gluten isn\u2019t bad for humans, as long as you&#8217;re eating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/health-canada-new-food-guide\/\">balanced diet<\/a>. So unless you\u2019ve been diagnosed with CD, there\u2019s no need to avoid that avocado toast or your nonna\u2019s pasta.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Symptoms of celiac disease can be obvious, or nonexistent, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a made up condition.
