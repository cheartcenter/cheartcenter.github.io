Since COVID-19 is a new virus, some questions about how the vaccine works are still being answered by the scientific community. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the COVID-19 vaccine when it comes to immunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is immunity?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your immune system is an intricate network of organs, tissues, and cells that work together to fight off pathogens \u2014 the bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms that cause disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re infected with a virus like COVID-19, it takes over healthy cells in your body. The virus has proteins on the outside called antigens, and when they\u2019re detected by your immune system, they trigger your immune response. Your immune response is your body\u2019s way of neutralizing disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One part of your immune response is the production of antibodies. Antibodies are y-shaped proteins that lock onto the virus antigens and help destroy them. The fewer infected cells in your system, the less strength the virus has to make you sick or spread a disease to others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your body destroys the infected cells, your immune system memorizes the steps it took to do so. If the same disease-causing agent enters your body again, your immune system uses its memory to identify, attack, and destroy it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each pathogen has unique antigens, which means no two illnesses are destroyed by the same type of antibody. That\u2019s why antibody development can take time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your body remembers how to identify and fight a pathogen, you start to recover faster if you\u2019re exposed to it again. In some cases, your body becomes so effective that you don\u2019t get sick at all. When your immune system is able to destroy a pathogen before it makes you sick, you have immunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are vaccines and how do they work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines typically contain weakened or inactive samples of a pathogen\u2019s antigen. In other words, vaccines are harmless samples of a disease. It may seem counterintuitive to intentionally expose yourself to a harmful organism, but vaccines are vetted for safety before they\u2019re approved for use. COVID-19 vaccines will go through extensive <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/drugs-health-products\/covid19-industry\/drugs-vaccines-treatments\/list-authorized-trials.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines are generally administered via injection. Oral and nasal vaccines also exist, though the COVID-19 vaccines likely won&#8217;t rely on these methods. Vaccines cause your body to react as if it were fighting a real infection. Your immune system learns to neutralize the pathogen so that you\u2019re better prepared to defeat it later if exposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, one vaccination is enough for your body to remember how to neutralize a harmful organism. With other diseases, multiple doses need to be administered before the body learns how to defend itself. That\u2019s why some vaccinations require booster shots. Some COVID-19 vaccines will require <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/health\/coronavirus\/historic-moment-health-canada-approves-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-1.5223477\">two doses<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people with compromised immune systems may not be good candidates for certain vaccines. Exposure to pathogens is risky because their body has trouble fending off disease. People with HIV or who have undergone chemotherapy may be in this category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Those with compromised immune systems can still benefit from widespread vaccination in their community. W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen enough people in close proximity are vaccinated, it\u2019s harder for a contagious disease to spread. This is called herd immunity, or community immunity. It\u2019s a form of protection for people who can\u2019t get vaccinated, since they\u2019re less likely to come in contact with someone who&#8217;s sick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immunity and COVID-19<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With other pandemics like H1N1, which is a strain of the flu virus, it was easier to create a vaccine and understand how immunity works. That\u2019s because similar flu viruses are known to scientists, and flu shots are given to the public every fall. That made it easier to come up with a vaccine fast, since there were already models approved by Health Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the flu virus, there\u2019s never been a widely distributed vaccine <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for coronaviruses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before. Plus, because COVID-19 is brand new, so there\u2019s a lot we\u2019re still discovering about how the virus affects us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to COVID-19 and immunity, a few questions are still being researched:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you still get COVID-19 if you\u2019ve been vaccinated?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/drugs-health-products\/covid19-industry\/drugs-vaccines-treatments\/list-authorized-trials.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> COVID-19 vaccines in development. Different vaccines have different rates of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/society\/health\/covid-19-vaccine-tracker-for-canadians\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">efficacy.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That means some vaccines don&#8217;t work 100% of the time, so it\u2019s possible for someone who has received a vaccination to still contract COVID-19. One front-runner vaccine reported <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/canada\/article-canada-will-be-among-first-countries-set-to-receive-moderna-vaccine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">94%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protection. That means there\u2019s a 6% chance that someone vaccinated with that vaccine will still get COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though vaccines aren\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s generally accepted that getting vaccinated poses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/vaccination-children\/safety-concerns-side-effects.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less danger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of health complications than getting sick from a disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get the COVID-19 vaccination, are you immune for life?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t know yet. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/q-a-detail\/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines?adgroupsurvey=%7Badgroupsurvey%7D&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAn7L-BRBbEiwAl9UtkBNz3MOoBM29NerbHs7y5FmLF-iL3q_IdISt4TljWZ2_n2uFHKMmjBoCJ-oQAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so far indicates that some people who\u2019ve had COVID-19 have shown resistance to reinfection. How long that resistance lasts is still unconfirmed.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve had COVID-19 already, are you immune?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No human trials have been done to see if someone who has had COVID-19 can get it again. Research <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-52446965\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suggests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that reinfection is unlikely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re in the early stages of understanding how COVID-19 impacts our immune systems. Different vaccines are being created by countries around the world. Once a vaccine has been approved in Canada, we\u2019ll have more information on what to expect.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A COVID-19 vaccine has been approved, but many of us still have questions about the way immunity will work.
