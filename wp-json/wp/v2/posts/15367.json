Some moms prefer to err on the side of caution and refuse to take any medications while they\u2019re breastfeeding. But not all nursing mothers have that option. Here\u2019s a general guide for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what you need to avoid until you\u2019re ready to wean your little one, and which medications are safe to take while breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How long do drugs stay in breastmilk?<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medications<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> end up in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mothers\u2019 milk<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how a baby responds will depend on how old they are and how much milk they consume. A two-week-old exclusively breastfed baby will likely be more affected than an eight-month-old who only nurses twice a day, for example. How long a drug stays in a woman\u2019s breast milk also depends on a number of factors. Everything from how quickly her metabolism works, to what the drug is and how it is taken. This is why you should discuss every drug you take with your doctor and your child\u2019s pediatrician.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Antibiotics &amp; breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that pregnant women shouldn\u2019t take certain antibiotics like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501102\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">streptomycin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because they can be dangerous to their developing fetus. The good news is that most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antibiotics<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 even some of the antibiotics that are contraindicated for pregnant women. Some mothers do report diarrhea or thrush in their nursing children when they use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK500887\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certain antibiotics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however symptoms typically don\u2019t persist beyond the treatment. In these cases, treating the mother\u2019s issue usually outweighs the slight symptoms the child might experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What cold medicine can I take while breastfeeding?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem like taking <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cold medicine while breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not. Some cold medicines contain codeine which is an opioid (pain-relieving drug). When a nursing mother takes codeine, her body <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501212\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turns it into morphine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ends up in her breast milk. Nursing children whose mothers take codeine are at risk for breathing issues, a decrease in heart rate and even death, especially in their first weeks of life. Breastfeeding women should never use products containing codeine and should discuss all medication, including over-the-counter (OTC) cold medication, with their doctor and pharmacist before taking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pain medication and breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understandably, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty over <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what pain medication is safe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the answer is complex. Most OTC medications like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK500986\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ibuprofen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501194\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acetaminophen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are safe for nursing mothers to take, but many prescription pain medications aren\u2019t. Opioid use by breastfeeding mothers, for example, can cause both sedation and respiratory distress in nursing infants. Children who are exposed to these drugs in their mother\u2019s milk may also go through withdrawal from the opioid when they stop breastfeeding or when their mother ceases to take the drug. When given in low dosages and closely monitored by a doctor, however, it may be possible to take certain opioids safely. Mothers who give birth via caesarean section or who have an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountsinai.on.ca\/patients\/having-a-baby-at-mount-sinai\/labour-and-birth\/pain-management\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">epidural<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during labour may receive morphine, fentanyl or remifentanil after all, all of which are powerful opioids.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Nursing and psychotropic medication<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-overlooked-aspects-of-postpartum-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpartum depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and anxiety are very real risks for new parents. While not all antidepressants have studies relating to breastfeeding, most research suggests that antidepressant use while breastfeeding isn\u2019t harmful to the child. The evidence surrounding the use of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anxiety medications<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, is more limited. It appears that nursing mothers may be able to take benzodiazepines (the class of medications containing anti-anxiety medication) safely as long as they watch their infants for signs of lethargy or breathing difficulties. In either case, your doctor should monitor you and your child closely. Usually, the risk of denying treatment to the nursing mother outweighs the risk to the nursing baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>List of drugs contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nursing mothers should discuss all medications, both prescription and OTC with their doctor and pharmacist before taking them. Most drugs do show up in breastmilk. And as with drinking and breastfeeding, \u201cpumping and dumping\u201d won\u2019t eliminate them from your milk. As well, not all dangerous substances are taken orally. Certain beauty products such as retinoids can pose a risk to your nursing child. You should always discuss their use with a dermatologist or doctor before taking them. Here are some of the drugs that are contraindicated while breastfeeding:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codeine<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/drugs\/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers\/use-codeine-and-tramadol-products-breastfeeding-women-questions-and-answers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tramadol<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/medications\/fdb1289#fdb1289-04\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naproxen<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK500783\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heroin<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501588\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cocaine<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medications and breastfeeding don&#8217;t always go together, so make sure to let your doctor know if you are breastfeeding. They should be up-to-date on which ones are safe while nursing, and you can always double check your prescription using the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501922\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LactMed database<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (they also have an app). Even though most medications you take will end up in your breastmilk, breastmilk is still the optimal source of nutrition for your child for their first two years of life. Breastfeeding mothers deserve treatment for their physical pain, illness and mental health. You don\u2019t have to choose between treating yourself and nursing your baby. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The rules around medications and breastfeeding are confusing.
