To get an in-person appointment, however, you first have to visit your family doctor for a referral. From there, it might be weeks (or months) before they call back with a date \u2014 Canadians wait an average of 90 days to see a dermatologist. That\u2019s a lot of time to have an issue both physically uncomfortable and socially embarrassing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin issues can even cause mental health challenges, as some of us experience <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4378256\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social anxiety and depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a result of our condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advancements in telemedicine are offering new options, however. Most dermatology assessments are done with the naked eye without ever needing to touch the patient. Because of this, dermatology might just be the perfect medical specialty to go virtual. All you need is the camera on your phone and a description of your symptoms. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What is tele-dermatology?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online dermatology (or tele-dermatology) is exactly what we described above. A dermatologist looking at pictures and the history of a patient\u2019s condition in a file sent by phone or computer. This allows them to diagnose and formulate a treatment plan, all without having to see the patient in person. Studies show that whether you see a dermatologist in person or virtually, you receive the same level of care and experience the same rate of symptom remission. As long as the photos are good quality, outcomes are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.ukzn.ac.za\/index.php\/JISfTeH\/article\/view\/161\/html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for patients using tele-dermatology\u00a0versus in-person consultations. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What can online dermatology help with?<\/h3>\n<p><b><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned, there\u2019s a litany of skin, hair and nail concerns that dermatologists treat. These include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/flu-treatment\/\">acne<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/hair-loss-alopecia-treatment\/\">alopecia (hair loss)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/rosacea-treatment\/\">rosacea<\/a>, psoriasis, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Rashes-treatment\">rashes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Eczema-treatment\">eczema<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Nail-Infections-treatment\">nail infections<\/a>, dermatitis, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Pigment-Disorders-treatment\">pigment disorders,<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/shingles-treatment\/\">shingles<\/a> to name a few. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online dermatology is also convenient for managing chronic skin issues as patients often have multiple follow-up appointments to track any changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How do I use Maple if I need a dermatologist?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t need a referral for our service as we work directly with Canadian dermatologists through our platform. To request a consultation, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/login\">log in<\/a> to your Maple account, click \u201csee doctor\u201d and select \u201cdermatology\u201d. Then, fill in a detailed description of your concern and attach any images you feel are necessary for review. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the dermatologist analyzes your file, you\u2019ll receive a full report including any advice, treatment plans and diagnoses that the dermatologist believes are necessary \u2014 in 24 hours or less!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Where is online dermatology available?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our online dermatology service is currently available in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Nunavut and Newfoundland and Labrador. We hope to expand the service to additional provinces in the coming months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Are prescriptions included?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes! Our dermatology service allows for a wide variety of prescriptions at the doctor&#8217;s discretion with the exception of controlled medications such as narcotics. Once you accept a prescription, you\u2019ll have the option to pick it up from any pharmacy or we\u2019ll deliver it right to your door at no additional cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How much does it cost?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultations aren\u2019t covered under provincial health plans since they\u2019re conducted via secure text message, and often with an out-of-province doctor to ensure your request can be picked up quickly. They cost $180 and include the applicable diagnosis, and any necessary treatment plans or prescriptions. You can also book 15-minute follow-up appointments for $90, if you or the dermatologist would like to follow your condition. For those with health insurance, we always recommend checking with your provider to see if our services can be covered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re worried a weird mole is something more ominous, or you\u2019re having a psoriasis flare up, seeing a dermatologist should be your first stop. Virtual dermatology can make it happen a whole lot faster.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our skin covers our entire body \u2014 it\u2019s the biggest organ we have and it might just be the one we pay attention to the most.
