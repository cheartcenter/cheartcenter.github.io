In reality, a staggering 58% of employees actually do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gap may be startling, but the reason it exists is that employees are hesitant to share their health concerns in the workplace. While chronic illnesses are long-term conditions that are a part of an employee&#8217;s daily life, they certainly don\u2019t want to be defined by this in the workplace. That said, chronic conditions like asthma, arthritis, and diabetes can make it difficult for employees to focus on their work due to discomfort, pain, stress, or fatigue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the thing: as an employer, you don\u2019t always need to know the exact chronic health conditions your employees are facing in order to support them. But it is important to put a strategy in place for helping your employees cope and reduce the inherent risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What exactly can your company do? Unlike boosting employee engagement, chronic illness requires a more nuanced and sensitive approach.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What employees actually need is the support to help themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronic illness management is a big problem for employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanofi.ca\/-\/media\/Project\/One-Sanofi-Web\/Websites\/North-America\/Sanofi-CA\/Home\/en\/Products-and-Resources\/sanofi-canada-health-survey\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">half of employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (55%) take at least one medication regularly to manage their chronic condition.

While not all of these employees skip their medicine, it\u2019s an indication that there are many hoops to jump through (e.g. booking an appointment, taking time off, waiting to see a doctor, sometimes repeating bloodwork, going to the pharmacy) to get a routine prescription.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanofi.ca\/-\/media\/Project\/One-Sanofi-Web\/Websites\/North-America\/Sanofi-CA\/Home\/en\/Products-and-Resources\/sanofi-canada-health-survey\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">52% of employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who report skipping medication say this happens about 25% of the time.
