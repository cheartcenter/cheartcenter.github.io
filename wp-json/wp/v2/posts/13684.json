Not exactly great news, but don\u2019t panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin rashes are often harmless. They can be the result of a reaction to a plant like poison ivy, heat, or a new detergent. Infections, allergens, or immune system disorders can also play a role.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many rashes can be easily managed, some can be a sign of a bigger problem, as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certain types of skin cancer can appear as a rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But how can you tell the difference between a rash that was caused by irritation, and one that\u2019s a more urgent concern?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Detecting skin cancer early<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to detect skin cancer early is simply to be familiar with your full body so that you can spot new <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or unusual growths, or changes in the shape, colour, or size of an existing mark.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find a rash on your body that isn\u2019t going away over time, speak to a doctor or a dermatologist. Avoid jumping to conclusions \u2013 many rashes are noncancerous. A trained healthcare professional can recognize skin cancer and properly diagnose the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many cancers develop where they can be easily seen, facilitating early detection, they can also develop <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in more hidden areas. Make sure to look at different parts of your body, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your face<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trunk<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legs\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between your toes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath your nails<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soles of your feet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your genitals<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Skin rashes, cancer, and skin conditions<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin cancer can initially appear as a rash, a lump, or an abnormal patch on the surface of the skin. These marks can bleed, ooze, and change in appearance over time. The most common forms of skin cancer \u2013 or conditions that can become skin cancer \u2013 include:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basal cell carcinomas<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A type of skin cancer that can appear as pink, red, or shiny growths on your skin. If it develops around the chest area, it can look like a skin-coloured lesion or a brown scar. Caused by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exposure to the sun, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this type of cancer rarely spreads, but can leave permanent scars if not treated properly. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squamous cell carcinomas <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A type of cancer that can develop as a rough lump on the surface of the skin. Unlike a skin rash that heals over time, these reddish patches will continue to develop slowly, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so make sure to consult a doctor or a dermatologist.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merkel cell carcinomas <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A less common form of cancer that can appear as red or skin-coloured nodules. They are usually found on parts of the body that are regularly exposed to the sun, like your face, scalp, or neck.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actinic keratoses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark or skin-coloured marks that can appear on your face, neck, scalp, shoulders, or other parts of your body that receive a lot of sun exposure. It can take years for these patches to develop, so they\u2019re usually a concern for people over the age of 40. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A small percentage of these types of lesions can become skin cancer over time. To reduce your risk, protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays by wearing sunscreen on non-covered areas, wearing long sleeves and pants, and seeking shade.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actinic cheilitis <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These appear in the form of sores or bumps on your lower lip. Your lip can also become red or swollen. Caused by long-term sun exposure, these bumps can turn into squamous cell carcinomas over time.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cutaneous horns <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are painful growths that are made from keratin, the protein that forms hair, skin, and nails. As the name suggests, cutaneous horns look a little like animal horns. They often grow out of cancerous or precancerous skin sores, so speak with a trained healthcare professional. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moles <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are individual growths that are often benign. They can also be a sign of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Moles can be black, brown, red, pink, or skin-coloured. Seek advice from a doctor or dermatologist if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One side of your mole looks different from the other.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mole has turned more than one colour.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your mole is dark in colour.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your mole is larger than 6 millimeters in width.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The border of your mole is fuzzy or irregular.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your mole is changing in appearance.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Preventing skin cancer<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple steps to protect your skin can help prevent skin cancer. Try:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can, stay indoors during the day when the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays are at their strongest, from mid-morning to late afternoon.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have to go outside, apply sunscreen to all exposed areas, including your lips and eyelids. Use a broad-spectrum (UVA\/UVB) SPF30. Make sure to reapply after a swim or if you\u2019re sweating a lot.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, like a bucket or broad-brimmed hat that can shield your face and neck. Cover your arms and legs with long clothing.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid tanning, either in a tanning bed or by staying outside. Even if you tan naturally, tanning damages your skin and increases your risk of melanoma.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many cancers cause rashes that can resemble less serious skin conditions, so discussing changes in your skin with an experienced healthcare professional can make a big difference. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you suspect something\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t wait. The sooner skin cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances are of curing it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Got a rash you\u2019re not sure about? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can speak with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a dermatologist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from anywhere using your phone, tablet, or computer.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Skin rashes can look suspicious.
