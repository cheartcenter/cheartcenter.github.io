But with proper care there\u2019s reason to be optimistic \u2014 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-type\/breast\/breast-cancer\/breast-cancer-in-men\/?region=on#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20the%205%2Dyear,for%20at%20least%205%20years.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of men diagnosed with breast cancer make a full recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symptoms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common symptom men with breast cancer experience is a small, painless lump under the nipple. Other possible symptoms include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nipple discharge.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bleeding from the nipple.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swollen or sore breasts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A suddenly inverted or inward pointing nipple.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An open sore, pimple, or rash on or near the nippple.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lump in the armpit.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crust forming on the nipple.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Causes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer forms in the body when cells start to multiply at a rapid rate, making them cancer cells. As they reproduce, the cancer cells overcrowd healthy cells and form tumours. The cancerous cells can spread to healthy tissue if cancer is left untreated. When that happens, it\u2019s called metastasizing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certain risk factors that make some men more likely to develop breast cancer. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family history<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If a close relative in your family has had breast cancer, your chances of developing it are higher.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exposure to radiation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radiation causes cells to multiply rapidly and form tumours. If your chest has been exposed to radiation, that\u2019s an even greater risk factor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrogen exposure <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men who take hormone therapy may have estrogen levels that are higher than normal. High estrogen levels have been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.breastcancer.org\/research-news\/men-w-high-estrogen-could-have-high-risk#:~:text=While%20the%20link%20between%20estrogen,average%20risk%20of%20breast%20cancer.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to an increased risk in breast cancer in men and women.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klinefelter syndrome <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a rare genetic condition where males are born with an extra X chromosome. It causes higher levels of estrogen and lower levels of androgens \u2014 the hormones responsible for male characteristics. The increase in estrogen production makes men with Klinefelter syndrome more likely to get breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men in their 60s and 70s are the highest risk group for breast cancer, though it\u2019s possible in younger men too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BRCA gene mutation <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both men and women, the BRCA2 gene mutation increases the likelihood of breast cancer. The mutation is passed from parent to child. The BCRA1 mutation comes with a higher risk of breast cancer too, but it\u2019s rarer than BCRA2.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obesity <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re overweight, your body carries a high number of fat cells. Fat cells can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/cancer-causes\/diet-physical-activity\/body-weight-and-cancer-risk.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0androgens into estrogen. High estrogen contributes to breast cancer formation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heavy drinking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drinking too much alcohol damages your liver. It leaves scars, creating a condition called cirrhosis. Cirrhosis of the liver triggers an increase in the production of estrogen and lowers androgen production, which may cause breast cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnosis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several ways that doctors test for the presence of breast cancer in men, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biopsy. Small samples of cells from the breast lump are sent to a lab to see if they\u2019re cancerous.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinical breast exam. During this exam a doctor manually checks for lumps in the patient\u2019s breast tissue or their underarms.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnostic mammogram. If you have any abnormalities during your clinical breast exam, this is the next step. A mammogram is a low-dose x-ray that produces images of the patient\u2019s breast tissue. Doctors examine the images for any abnormalities or lumps that have formed in the breast.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stages<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If breast cancer is confirmed in a patient, their doctor will evaluate how far the cancer has advanced. The stages of cancer are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage zero. No cancerous tumours have formed yet, but abnormal cells have been detected.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage one. There\u2019s a small amount of cancer present, contained to one part of the body.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage two and three, where cancer has spread to tissue near the original cancer site, including the lymph nodes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage four. Cancer has spread throughout the body.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatments<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To treat breast cancer in men, options include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surgery. Surgeons remove the cancerous tumour in a procedure known as a lumpectomy.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chemotherapy. This is a drug treatment program that kills or suppresses the growth of cancer cells over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radiation. This method uses powerful x-rays to destroy cancerous cells or reduce a tumour\u2019s size.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormone therapy. These therapies either increase, decrease, or eliminate the presence of a given hormone. When it comes to breast cancer, hormone therapy would be used to reduce estrogen production.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because breast cancer in men is rare, sometimes men <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/tag\/why-dont-men-go-to-the-doctor\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ignore symptoms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> until cancer has developed to an advanced stage. This can put men in a dangerous position. With early intervention, men can recover from breast cancer. If you\u2019re noticing abnormalities in your breast tissue, make an appointment with your doctor to check if everything is healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cancer is a scary disease to cope with on your own.
