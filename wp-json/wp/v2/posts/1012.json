We need to\u00a0embrace emerging technologies and telehealth to make better use of the physicians that already serve our communities.<\/p>\n<p>Telehealth (aka telemedicine, e-health) is the remote delivery of healthcare using interactive text, audio, and video technology. It\u00a0has the power to transform our healthcare delivery models, and create space for quicker and more comfortable access to care. However, while telehealth\u00a0has seen massive adoption in other countries, the adoption rate in Canada is less than 1%.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding wait times in Canadian healthcare<\/h2>\n<p>Canadians are generally\u00a0happy with the quality of care received once they\u00a0see a doctor. However, we\u00a0consistently rank below all other developed countries when it comes to wait times to see the doctor. \u00a0This is according to CIHI, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, which evaluates\u00a0the performance of our healthcare system.<\/p>\n<p>Key insights from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cihi.ca\/en\/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016\">latest Canadian CIHI study<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20% reported waiting +7 days to see a family doctor the last time they needed medical attention<\/li>\n<li>43% were able to receive same or next day access to care<\/li>\n<li>33% reported waiting +4 hours at the ER<\/li>\n<li>50% reported waiting +4 weeks to see a specialist<\/li>\n<li>41% were not able to get\u00a0a\u00a0same day answer when they contact their regular doctor\u2019s office with a medical concern<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The lack of access during alternative\u00a0times, such as after hours or during weekends, leaves patients with limited options. Instead of attending their family physicians, patients end up\u00a0relying on walk-in clinics or the emergency room. 41% of Canadians say they use the emergency room\u00a0for conditions their family physician could have treated, had they been available.\u00a0This puts an unnecessary financial strain on our healthcare system, as patients with routine issues turn to other more costly means.<\/p>\n<h2>So why don\u2019t more Canadian doctors work full-time?<\/h2>\n<p>The demand from our aging and growing population on the healthcare system\u00a0results in limited\u00a0funding for investment in healthcare resources. Doctors, especially specialists, rely on operating rooms, equipment, hospital beds, nurses, and other infrastructure to provide care. For\u00a0example, 178 fully trained orthopaedic surgeons in Canada are\u00a0unemployed; 78% of newly-graduated ENT specialists (ear, nose and throat) failed to find a job due to lack of funding. Yet the wait times for specialist care are +4 weeks for 50% of Canadians.<\/p>\n<p>In primary care, doctors continue to see a reduction in billing rates and earnings which makes it difficult to\u00a0cover the costs of operating clinics, especially during evening and weekend hours.<\/p>\n<h2>How can telehealth help?<\/h2>\n<p>The majority of common primary care issues can be treated\u00a0solely with a visual or verbal examination. Technologies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple\u00a0<\/a>create space for doctors to see and treat patients right in\u00a0their home, whether it&#8217;s by phone, videoconferencing, or other means of instant communication.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors working under full capacity\u00a0in the physical world can now provide extra care at no additional cost. This means they do not need to hire additional\u00a0staff or incur costs to run a\u00a0clinic overtime, one of the greatest obstacles to expanding after hours availability.<\/p>\n<p>For patients,\u00a0telehealth means quicker and more comfortable access to care.\u00a0Telehealth empowers\u00a0a cancer patient to speak to an oncologist about their diagnosis at any time. It allows a worried parent to get a physician&#8217;s advice from home at 2AM instead of making a potentially expensive and inconvenient trip to a local ER.<\/p>\n<p>Telehealth is a budding industry in the health provision ecosystem. Discoveries and ventures have, and will continue to lead groundbreaking developments in healthcare. For example, \u00a0\u201cwearables\u201d and innovation in remote monitoring devices that measure vital signs will even\u00a0further increase the rate of remote diagnosis and treatment. This means up to\u00a0126 million visits to Canadian clinics or hospitals can be prevented and treated much quicker in the community.<\/p>\n<p>By expanding physician capacity to provide care and creating better patient experiences, telehealth can significantly lead to better access to care.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We believe the solution to improving access to care lies in our ability to innovate.
