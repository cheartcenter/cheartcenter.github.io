When wintertime comes, the days are shorter and we\u2019re more inclined to huddle indoors beside a fireplace. The pandemic adds another hurdle, since many of us are minimizing time outside to stay safe. Less exposure to sunlight means our vitamin D levels go down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, sunlight isn\u2019t the only source of vitamin D \u2014 it\u2019s also possible to get this nutrient from your diet. Here\u2019s how vitamin D affects your body, and foods to help you get enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How vitamin D affects your body<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamin D plays an essential role in helping your body absorb calcium. Calcium keeps your bones and teeth strong, enables proper muscle movement, and contributes to heart and nerve function. Low levels of calcium can result in diseases like osteoporosis, as well as tooth decay and cataracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommended dose of vitamin D is different in provinces across Canada. Work with your doctor to find the level that\u2019s right for you. Generally, Health Canada <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/food-nutrition\/healthy-eating\/vitamins-minerals\/vitamin-calcium-updated-dietary-reference-intakes-nutrition.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that adults aged 19-50 should try to get 800 IU (20 mcg) of vitamin D from their diets each day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk factors for low vitamin D<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to lack of sunlight, there are a few other factors that contribute to your ability to get enough vitamin D. People with darker skin absorb less of the sun\u2019s UV rays, which can result in less production of vitamin D. If you\u2019re 50 or older, your risk of deficiency increases too. Your body produces less vitamin D as you age.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods to eat to increase your levels of vitamin D<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salmon<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the types of fatty fish, salmon has the highest vitamin D levels. Every 75 grams of salmon <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/healthlinkbc-files\/sources-calcium-vitamin-d\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has 245 IU<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of vitamin D, which is a little over a quarter of the daily recommended amount. Salmon is also rich in other healthy nutrients that will come in handy over the winter months. It\u2019s a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/lifestyle\/wellness\/if-youre-feeling-the-winter-blues-eat-fish\/2015\/02\/17\/24194fc2-b169-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> alleviate seasonal depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mushrooms\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There aren\u2019t many vegetables that have significant amounts of vitamin D. Mushrooms are the exception. When exposed to UV light, mushrooms create vitamin D naturally, just like humans. Since lots of mass-produced mushrooms are grown in environments with low light, not every mushroom has had the chance to soak up sunny rays. That makes some mushrooms higher in vitamin D than others. Where possible, opt for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S027869151300118X\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wild<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> foraged mushrooms since you can be sure of their sun exposure. Seven button mushrooms account for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mushrooms.ca\/vitamin-d\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your daily recommended vitamin D.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs yolks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs are a nutrient-rich food with many health benefits, including significant levels of vitamin D. Egg yolks are what holds the most vitamins. After being cooked, egg yolks contain 32 IU of vitamin D each.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/organic-eggs-nutrition-1.3485640\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be high in nutrients when they\u2019re free range, or come from sources that allow animals exposure to sunlight. Opt for farm-raised eggs if you\u2019re in particular need of a vitamin D boost this winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canned fish<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tinned fish is a great meal option if you\u2019re looking for a simple, quick way to add vitamin D to your diet. Canned salmon, tuna, and sardines all have high <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/healthlinkbc-files\/sources-calcium-vitamin-d\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amounts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the sunshine vitamin, offering 202 IU, 36 IU, and 70 IU respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milk<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamin D is fat soluble, meaning it\u2019s present in foods with high fat levels. When milk\u2019s fat content is reduced from whole milk down to 2%, 1%, or skim, the vitamin D content decreases too. To counter this, cow\u2019s milk and other dairy products like cheese are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.neilsondairy.com\/en\/faq\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fortified<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with vitamin D in Canada. Depending on the fat percentage, one cup of milk can have up to 103 IU of vitamin D.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortified alternative milks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If dairy isn\u2019t a regular part of your diet, you can still get a dosage of vitamin D from alternative milks. They\u2019re often fortified with vitamins, just like cow\u2019s milk. Fortified soy milk, nut milks, and rice milk are good sources of vitamin D. 16 oz of the average soy milk offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tools.myfooddata.com\/nutrition-facts\/175215\/wt9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your daily vitamin D needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tofu<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn to fortified tofu for plant-based vitamin D this winter. Like other fortified foods, some tofu brands add vitamins and minerals to give the tofu more nutritional benefits. Fortified tofu contains about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfooddata.com\/articles\/high-vitamin-D-foods.php#vitamin-d-foods\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the daily recommended amount of vitamin D per 100 grams.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orange juice<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it doesn\u2019t naturally contain vitamin D, many brands of orange juice are fortified with both vitamin D and calcium. Since vitamin D improves calcium absorption, this combination is especially beneficial. Orange juice provides about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.floridacitrus.org\/oj\/health-nutrition\/oj-nutrition-facts\/calcium-and-vitamin-d\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your daily vitamin D needs per serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain healthy vitamin D levels, a combination of diet and lifestyle is key. In addition to eating foods rich in vitamin D, make sure to get some sunlight this winter. Try a mid-day walk the next time it\u2019s sunny. If you have more time on your hands, consider a solo outdoor sport like skiing or snowshoeing. Safe, physically-distanced social outings and a balanced diet will go a long way towards optimal vitamin D levels this winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you want expert help in putting together a healthy winter diet, speak to our registered dietitians online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vitamin D is essential for your health, but it&#8217;s tough to get during wintertime.
