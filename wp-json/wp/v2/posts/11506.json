Maybe you\u2019re already doing grocery runs for your elderly parents or your sister with Lyme disease. Are there additional measures you could be taking? We\u2019ve compiled a list of everything you\u2019ll want to do if you\u2019re caring for elderly parents or someone who is immunocompromised during the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Limit your exposure<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know all about social distancing by now and most of us are only seeing the people we live with at the moment. Unfortunately, mitigating risk also applies to more crucial services as well. Many long-term care homes are barring family and non-essential staff because of how vulnerable their residents are to complications from COVID-19. If you have home healthcare workers or personal support workers (PSWs) coming through your place for your loved one, you should consider if they\u2019re absolutely necessary and cancel any non-essential visits. For those who must come, you\u2019ll need to ensure safety measures are being followed. For starters, PSWs and any other visitors should wash their hands immediately upon entry (check out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/13\/world\/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html?referringSource=articleShare\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how to do that properly). Workers should also wear gloves and masks and sanitize all medical equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Doctor visits<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Older adults are more likely to have ongoing health issues, requiring follow-up trips to the doctor. While certain conditions may require in-person visits, telehealth is a great option for a number of issues that don\u2019t \u2014 things like prescription renewals, rashes, UTIs and joint pains. Seeing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doctor online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of in person is one more way for your loved ones to limit their exposure to COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to stock up safely<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to grocery shop. But even with new measures in place, grocery stores present a challenge \u2014 they\u2019re full of people, some of whom may be sick. If possible, order your groceries online for pickup or delivery. Many retailers are waiving fees at the moment to make these services more accessible. Pharmacies also deliver, which can help you avoid their long line ups. Demand for these services is understandably much higher at the moment, so give yourself extra time to order so you don\u2019t run out of supplies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do have to go into the store for whatever reason, make sure to keep a space of at least two metres between yourself and others. As well, it\u2019s a good idea to wear gloves when you go: the handles of grocery carts are often repositories for germs. Just make sure you don\u2019t ever touch your face with your gloves, and also make sure to throw away your gloves once done at the store, followed by immediate hand washing. And using disposable bags is best right now \u2014 reusable ones are likely <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uanews.arizona.edu\/story\/reusable-grocery-bags-contaminated-with-e-coli-other-bacteria\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">none too clean<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> even when there isn\u2019t a pandemic going on. Try to touch as little as possible while doing your shopping, and wash your hands immediately after returning home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Keeping the house clean<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019re all upping the amount of cleaning we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not a good idea to have your usual cleaners coming into your home right now, no matter how good of a job they do. Instead, you\u2019ll want to make sure to disinfect high traffic areas yourself \u2014 light switches, door knobs and toilet handles for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you live in an apartment building, pay special attention to communal hot spots like elevator buttons and push bars when going in and out. While you\u2019re not expected to clean these, don\u2019t touch them unless it\u2019s via elbow bump or while wearing gloves. COVID-19 can live on certain surfaces for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMc2004973\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to 72 hours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so you don\u2019t want to pick it up on your hands and bring it home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has changed our way of living dramatically. But if you\u2019re taking care of someone in a high-risk group, the threat of this illness is likely even more destabilizing. It\u2019s important to remember though, that simple things like handwashing and staying home can make a big difference. Follow our guidelines to help mitigate the risk, and if you think you\u2019ve been exposed, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and self-isolate.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We know that the risk of complications from COVID-19 is higher for those over 60 or those with an underlying medical condition.
