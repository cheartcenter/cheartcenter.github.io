All together, they paint a picture of your mental well-being. Mental health and mental illness are usually talked about together, but they\u2019re not the same thing. Here\u2019s an introduction to what mental health really is, and the most common mental illnesses affecting Canadians.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between mental illness and mental health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has mental health. It\u2019s your level of psychological, emotional, and social wellbeing. You have varying states of mental health, just like you have different states of physical health. When you get a cold, you experience a short period of physical illness. Your mental health fluctuates in the same way throughout your life. Sometimes your mental health is great, but inevitably, life\u2019s rough patches will cause the occasional mental health decline. In these times, just like when you\u2019re sick, things like rest, care, and medicine can help get your mental health back on track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental illness and mental health aren\u2019t interchangeable terms \u2014 they mean two different things. Mental illness is a health condition. When you\u2019re mentally ill, you experience changes to your thinking, emotions, or behaviour that impair your ability to function socially. If you\u2019re living with a mental illness, you\u2019re not alone. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadians either have a mental illness currently, or have had one in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike mental health, not everyone experiences mental illness. If you have a period where you feel sad or stressed, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re mentally ill. Fluctuations in your feeling of well-being are a natural part of life. It\u2019s when your thoughts, feelings and behaviour start negatively affecting your daily life that it\u2019s possible you\u2019re living with a mental illness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common mental illnesses\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of different types of mental illness. Sometimes mental illness is chronic, meaning it lasts for a year or longer and requires management like therapy or medication. With other mental illnesses, the duration is shorter and you may be able to manage them completely with the right support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mood and anxiety disorders<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mood and anxiety disorders are the most <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/diseases-conditions\/mood-anxiety-disorders-canada.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">common<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mental illnesses in Canada. Each one has different symptoms, but there are some general commonalities. People with a mental illness from this category have persistent feelings of anxiety, fear, or nervousness and low mood. In one year, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/daily-quotidien\/200806\/dq200806a-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.4 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadians reported they\u2019re living with a mood or anxiety disorder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This group of mental illnesses includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panic disorder, which causes people to have feelings of intense fear when there is no real danger.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). With OCD, people experience obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that make it hard to function in everyday life.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bipolar disorder. This illness comes with periods of intense emotional highs called manic states, followed by periods of depression.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major depression. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/depression-signs-and-symptoms-how-to-recognize-depression\/\">Depression<\/a> causes long periods of deep sadness and disinterest in socializing or activities you once enjoyed.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating disorders<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/six-signs-you-might-have-an-eating-disorder\/\">Eating disorders<\/a> are a group of mental illnesses that distort your relationship with food, causing changes in your thoughts and behaviours around eating. With some eating disorders, people eat very little food. Others cause people to binge eat or overeat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nied.ca\/about-eating-disorders-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadians are living with an eating disorder. This group of mental illnesses has the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21727255\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mortality rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common eating disorders include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anorexia nervosa. People with anorexia may have a body weight that\u2019s dangerously low. The illness causes people to limit their eating or to exercise excessively in order to avoid weight gain. With anorexia, people often feel like their body mass is larger than it really is.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bulimia nervosa. Bulimia is characterized by a binge-purge cycle. Binging is classified as eating a large amount of food at once, usually more than 1000 calories, while feeling out-of-control. People with bulimia then purge in an attempt to \u201cget rid\u201d of the calories by inducing themselves to vomit, excessively exercising, or taking laxatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Substance use disorders<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Substance use disorder is also referred to as addiction. In Canada, around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ontario.cmha.ca\/addiction-and-substance-use-and-addiction\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people will\u00a0 use substances during their lifetime.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Substances include legal intoxicants like alcohol and prescription medication, as well as illegal drugs. The characteristics of abuse, like knowing how much is too much, vary depending on the substance. Still, people with substance misuse disorder often experience the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.painscale.com\/article\/the-4-c-s-of-addiction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four Cs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craving. Your system becomes dependent on a substance and you feel sick without it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compulsion. This is where your urge to use grows over time and becomes overpowering.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequences. Despite negative effects on areas of your life like relationships or finances, you continue to use the substance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Control issues. You feel unable to limit your substance use or stop altogether.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re experiencing challenges with mental illness, don\u2019t go through it alone. Millions of Canadians have periods of mental illness in their lifetimes. Treatment can provide relief.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with a therapist can help you get to the bottom of stress and unhappiness, and help you build coping skills to handle life\u2019s obstacles. The health of your mind is important to your overall enjoyment of life. If you want to try therapy, you can see a therapist online from the comfort of your home.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mental health is a commonly talked-about topic, but its definition is a bit fuzzy.
