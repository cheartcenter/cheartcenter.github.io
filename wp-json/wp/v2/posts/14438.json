Some do it more, some less, but it\u2019s part of having an immature digestive system and it\u2019s usually not a big deal. Acid <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflux<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, is an entirely different story. For <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflux<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, eating can become an uncomfortable and painful experience, making a new parent\u2019s anxiety skyrocket. It\u2019s not always easy to diagnose a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflux<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but here\u2019s what you need to know to tell the difference between normal and concerning baby behaviour.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do you know if your baby has acid reflux?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-acidic reflux<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also known as spitting up, is normal and expected. Babies do this because their gastrointestinal system is still developing. Sometimes they take in more formula or breastmilk than their system can handle, causing some of it to come back up. Many babies spit up every day for their first six months \u2014 or longer. Usually it\u2019s just a little breastmilk or formula, but occasionally your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spit up curdled milk<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (this happens when the milk sits in the stomach acid for a bit). Babies usually take spitting up in stride. They\u2019re often happy to eat immediately afterwards and might not seem to even notice that they\u2019ve spit up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acid reflux in babies (aka gastroesophageal reflux) is different. This happens when stomach acid flows backwards from the stomach, up into the esophagus \u2014 the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In adults, you\u2019d recognize the feeling as heartburn or acid reflux. This can be pretty uncomfortable for babies, and their behaviour reflects that \u2014 acid reflux in babies is usually diagnosed based on their behavioural symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of acid reflux in babies<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spitting up after each feed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arching their body during or after feeding<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crying after or during feed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choking or gasping sounds during feeding<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulling off the breast or away from the bottle frequently<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to gain weight or grow\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to help a baby with reflux<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s tempting to ask your pediatrician for a prescription to fix your child\u2019s reflux, this isn\u2019t always the best course of action. The medications that treat reflux make the baby&#8217;s stomach acid less acidic, which can increase the baby\u2019s risk of getting certain infections like lower respiratory tract infections. Because of this, doctors may suggest less interventionist methods like an elimination diet first. This involves eliminating many of the foods you eat (especially known irritants like caffeine and dairy) to see if that reduces symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few other things you can also do to minimize <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treat<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflux in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first is to burp your baby more frequently. Try pausing their nursing session every 10-15 minutes for a burp. Feeding them smaller meals more frequently as opposed to one big one can also help. Especially important is to keep them upright for half an hour after nursing to minimize the opportunity for reflux. These methods are also helpful for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treating babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">silent reflux,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> though this might be more difficult to diagnose as babies with silent reflux often swallow the spit up, so symptoms aren\u2019t as obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is time the best cure for reflux in babies?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflux in babies is usually due to the immaturity of the esophagus and as your baby grows the esophagus will too. This means that most babies <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do grow out of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflux when<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their esophagus matures a little, usually between six months to a year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some doctors think that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpeds.com\/article\/S0022-3476(11)00897-3\/fulltext\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acid reflux is overdiagnosed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in babies. Newborns cry a lot and newborns with colic cry even more. And the symptoms of colic (crying, arching the body, turning away from a feed) often look like acid reflux. This can make it seem like the baby has a painful digestive problem when they might \u201cjust\u201d be colicky. And while colic is overwhelming and difficult, giving baby acid reflux medication doesn\u2019t solve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Medication for reflux in babies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solution<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infant\u2019s acid reflux<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should involve their doctor. While you can safely treat your heartburn with an over-the-counter (OTC) medication, the same can\u2019t be said for babies. Many OTC acid reflux meds contain Aspirin, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/healthy-living\/your-health\/diseases\/reye.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">isn\u2019t safe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give to anyone under the age of 18. If your baby\u2019s reflux is causing pain, or preventing them from growing and gaining weight, then medication is a great alternative.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to see a doctor<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby is vomiting blood or what looks like coffee grounds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If baby vomits bile (a green or yellow liquid)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby vomits after eating (as opposed to spitting up)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/a-parents-guide-to-baby-poop\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s stool has blood<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in it<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Child seems to be in pain while eating or following a feed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If baby is dehydrated<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re concerned baby\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t normal<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby spit up is a pain to clean up, but in most cases it\u2019s a normal part of your child\u2019s development and they\u2019ll likely grow out of it.

If you\u2019re concerned that your child\u2019s spitting up is abnormal or that eating is causing them discomfort, speak to their doctor. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acid reflux in adults isn&#8217;t difficult to treat, but helping a baby with reflux is more complex.
