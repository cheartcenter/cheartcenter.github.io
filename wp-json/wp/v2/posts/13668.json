If your pet seems sick, you take them to the vet. If your loved ones don\u2019t feel well, you tell them to see a doctor. But for some reason when it comes to caring for ourselves, we often skip doing the things that we\u2019d always do for others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women, with their unique anatomy, need specific tests at specific points in their lives. Some conventional wisdom you\u2019ve heard, like \u201cEveryone needs an annual physical exam,\u201d isn&#8217;t true anymore. Other tests, like pap smears, are important to schedule regularly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t know where to start? We\u2019ve got you covered! Here are the five medical appointments that women should pencil into their calendar.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Yearly checkup<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have pre-existing health conditions, or have risk factors for chronic illness, you should schedule a checkup with your doctor once a year. If you\u2019re otherwise healthy and have no pressing symptoms, you don\u2019t need to schedule a yearly visit.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common wisdom once dictated we should all get our yearly physical. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/choosingwiselycanada.org\/health-check-ups\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, that practice is no longer promoted.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Evidence suggests that yearly exams and over-testing create too many false positives for newfound health conditions. This creates anxiety and burdens the healthcare system, without producing better health for patients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For women who have risk factors like high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, or are older in age, a yearly checkup is helpful. At your checkup the doctor will take your weight, check your blood pressure, and ask you questions about your day-to-day habits. How often do you exercise? Do you smoke or drink alcohol? What is your typical diet like?\u00a0 These key pieces of information create a fuller picture of your health based on your routine habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Pap test<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pap test, also called a pap smear, is an essential part of a woman\u2019s healthcare plan. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/pap-smear-purpose-procedure-results-frequency-maple\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the test<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the doctor will perform a visual examination, and also use a swab to collect cells from the cervix for lab testing. If tests come back abnormal, it could be a sign of human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer if untreated. If caught early, doctors can intervene if a pap test comes back with any red flags. But don\u2019t stress too much \u2014 <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cwhn.ca\/node\/40773\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less than 10% of pap smears come back abnormal.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re sexually active or over 21 years old, a pap test is suggested every 3 years if the ongoing results are normal. Women with HIV or conditions that lower immune function may need to get testing more often. Work with your doctor to figure out which cadence is best for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Breast exam<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast exams help to detect cancerous lumps in the breast. But, they\u2019re not recommended for women under the age of 50. Just like with physical exams, the risk of false positives is too great for younger women who don\u2019t currently have pressing symptoms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women between the age of 50-69 can elect to have a breast exam every 2-3 years. These screenings are done by mammography, which involves diagnostic imaging of the breast. When scheduling a breast exam, weigh the risks of a false positive versus the risk of late diagnosis. It\u2019s a lot for a patient to take on, so talk to your doctor about whether breast exams are advisable for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between visits, doctors recommend that you stay familiar with your own breasts. Note that performing breast self-exams is not recommended anymore. Staying aware of your body, but not over-monitoring it, can help you stay abreast of any changes that need a doctor\u2019s assessment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Blood glucose test<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in your forties, it\u2019s time to start getting a blood glucose test every 3 years. This test screens for diabetes and prediabetes.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/uq1235abc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Without treatment, diabetes causes vision impairment, kidney failure, and nerve damage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A family history of diabetes puts you at increased risk of developing it yourself. If you\u2019re in a high-risk group, you\u2019ll need to receive blood glucose testing more frequently. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.diabetes.ca\/type-2-risks\/risk-factors---assessments\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People of African, Arab, Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous, or South Asian descent are at higher risk for diabetes than others<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Obese individuals are also at higher risk for diabetes, and will need more frequent screening. Nutritionists and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dietitian\/\">dietitians<\/a> can help with dietary recommendations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Bone density screening<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women over 65 should get a bone density test, called a DEXA scan, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nof.org\/patients\/diagnosis-information\/bone-density-examtesting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every 2 years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you\u2019re over 50 and have fractured a bone because of fragility, you&#8217;ll want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/osteoporosis.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/Quick_Reference_Guide_October_2010.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">start bone density tests a little earlier<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These tests help:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Catch osteoporosis early.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See if osteoporosis is improving or worsening.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine how well osteoporosis medications are working.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These screenings also help predict how likely you are to break a bone in the future. Especially after menopause, a broken bone is a sign that it\u2019s time to make bone density screening part of your routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The big takeaway is this \u2014 if you don\u2019t have any risk factors for disease, and you\u2019re young in age, don\u2019t hurry to schedule health screening appointments. Things like physical exams can flag false positives, which are extremely anxiety-producing for the patient. Schedule a checkup with your doctor if you\u2019re feeling sick, if you\u2019ve noticed new symptoms, or to manage chronic diseases and risk factors. Healthcare is individual, and having a relationship with your healthcare team can help you form the right care plan for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need to see a doctor for health advice, to take care of pesky symptoms, or for a prescription refill, our doctors can help. Some important health tests require a doctor\u2019s hands-on care, but many non-urgent matters don\u2019t. Best of all, you can stay at home in your comfy slippers, while getting the help you need.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are lots of tests a woman should take over the course of her life to ensure she&#8217;s in good health.
