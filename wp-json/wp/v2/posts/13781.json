They\u2019re not as simple as wanting to lose five pounds, or avoiding carbohydrates because of a new diet trend. An eating disorder is a mental illness that makes you obsessed with weight, body shape, and food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friends and family members will often wonder \u201cWhy did this happen? They seemed so happy before.\u201d There\u2019s no satisfying answer to this question because every person with an eating disorder is different. One consistent thread is inner turmoil. A person\u00a0 might develop an eating disorder to cope with a chaotic life, other mental health issues, or having few social bonds. Society\u2019s beauty standards are usually not the only factor, although they do play a role. Society prizes unrealistic body types that can lead to constant dissatisfaction with your own body.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the different types of eating disorders?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many types of eating disorders. New types are still being discovered as doctors learn about different signs and symptoms. The list below contains the most common eating disorders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anorexia<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationaleatingdisorders.org\/learn\/by-eating-disorder\/anorexia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anorexia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> consume less food than is required for daily life. This is fueled by an intense fear of becoming fat, even though the person may be underweight.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bulimia<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationaleatingdisorders.org\/learn\/by-eating-disorder\/bulimia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bulimia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often follow a binge-purge cycle. They may also undereat when purging is not an option. After large meals, a person with bulimia will attempt to \u201cget rid\u201d of calories by inducing themselves to vomit, taking laxatives, or excessively exercising.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binge eating disorder<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationaleatingdisorders.org\/learn\/by-eating-disorder\/bed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">binge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> eating disorder consume large amounts of food in a small window of time. They\u2019ll feel out of control and unable to stop themselves from eating. Binge eating can cause a lot of shame and distress, which continues the unhealthy relationship with food.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orthorexia<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/orthorexia-nervosa-101#what-is-orthorexia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">orthorexia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are preoccupied with healthy eating to the point that their diet becomes extremely restrictive. There may not be a weight loss goal with orthorexia. Instead, focus is placed on the \u201cpurity\u201d of diet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compulsive exercise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise is healthy and makes us feel good, but it can also turn into an unhealthy coping mechanism. People who compulsively exercise may feel guilt if they can\u2019t get their usual workouts in. They may also exercise at the expense of other obligations in their life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationaleatingdisorders.org\/learn\/by-eating-disorder\/osfed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSFED<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to be called \u201ceating disorder not otherwise specified\u201d (EDNOS). It\u2019s a term for eating disorders that don\u2019t fit neatly into any of the above categories. People with OSFED have many eating disorder behaviours. For example, they might show all of the symptoms of anorexia, except for extreme weight loss.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are signs that you or a loved one might have an eating disorder?<\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Preoccupation with food, nutritional information, and diet culture<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As eating disorders take hold, patients become more and more obsessed with food and nutrition. They might watch cooking shows, read cookbooks, and compulsively read nutritional information on packaged food. People with eating disorders are known to cook elaborate meals for friends and family, while eating scant little themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, people with eating disorders are driven to lose weight. They might look at diet advertisements, weight-loss programs, and even eating disorder internet forums.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all leads to a lifestyle of being <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/a\/feast-ed.org\/ed-glossary\/2-eating-disorders-symptoms-and-behaviors\/food-preoccupation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surrounded by food<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, the person with the eating disorder is not allowed to eat it. The preoccupation with food is likely a symptom of both mental illness, and of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theprojectheal.org\/healblog\/impact-of-starvation-on-behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starvation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Food rituals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people with eating disorders develop compulsive behaviours around eating. When these <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/a\/feast-ed.org\/ed-glossary\/2-eating-disorders-symptoms-and-behaviors\/eating-rituals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rituals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are interrupted, the person can experience a great deal of anxiety and refuse to eat altogether. Rituals around might include weighing food very precisely, using the same spoon or plate, disassembling food (like taking a sandwich apart), chopping food into tiny pieces, and only eating at specified times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Secrecy around food<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrecy is one of the hallmarks of an eating disorder. Eating is a social connector, which makes it hard for people with eating disorders to carry on their behaviours without being noticed. Part of the illness is the belief\u00a0 that people offering help are only trying to sabotage their weight loss.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with eating disorders might skip meals and claim they\u2019ve already eaten. Or, they might take food off their plate and hide it in their clothing pockets. People might induce themselves to vomit quietly or mask the noise with other sounds, like a running shower. Or, they might only want to eat when they\u2019re alone so their food rituals won\u2019t draw attention. Eating disorders drive people to become more and more secretive as the condition worsens and the need for treatment becomes urgent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Fear of food<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating disorders lead people to adopt irrational and extreme fears of certain foods. Many patients have a list of \u201cfear foods\u201d that they believe will make them fat, or will cause extreme anxiety if they\u2019re on a menu.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fear of food can start off minor. Maybe the person decides \u201cNo more junk food,\u201d which sounds reasonable enough for a healthy person to say. Instead of having a relaxed attitude toward their new diet rule, the person will be extremely strict with themselves about never consuming these foods. The list of forbidden food tends to grow over time so that relatively healthy foods are included. Eventually, the list of acceptable foods is much shorter than the list of forbidden foods.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just food that people with eating disorders are afraid of. It\u2019s also the idea of being forced to receive treatment. Treatment for eating disorders often involves a weight-gain diet plan, which can be terrifying for someone who doesn\u2019t feel ready for that step.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Getting sick often<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not eating enough calories, vitamins, and minerals can lead to lowered immune system function. People with eating disorders may find that they get sick often, and can never quite shake their cough or cold. They might also feel cold all the time, experience fainting, and find that their wounds heal slowly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Feeling guilty<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly all eating disorders encompass some element of guilt, whether around eating, exercising, purging, or for seeking treatment. When compulsive eating disorder behaviours can\u2019t be performed, the patient may feel extreme anxiety and guilt. This guilt can only be remedied by performing the behaviours later on, when they\u2019re alone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guilt is also extremely common for the eating disorder patient\u2019s family members. Many parents and guardians rack their brains for one memory, one triggering event that could explain how the mental illness developed. In reality, eating disorders don\u2019t discriminate between \u201cgood families\u201d and \u201cbad families.\u201d While eating disorders do develop out of internal stress and trauma, families shouldn\u2019t automatically blame themselves. The blame game diverts attention from what\u2019s really important \u2014 supporting the person in their recovery and modelling healthy behaviours for them to follow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to get help for an eating disorder<\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Take the brave step<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeking treatment for an eating disorder is a whirlwind of emotions. On one hand, you\u2019re committing to being strong, healthy, and self-sufficient in your life going forward. On the other hand, it can feel like you\u2019re \u201cbetraying\u201d your eating disorder. Your eating disorder might also be a coping mechanism for uncontrollable trauma in your life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing\u2019s for sure, you are the most important participant in your treatment journey. It takes concerted effort to go against a very strong eating disorder voice in your head. This is not a process you have to go alone \u2014 there&#8217;s lots of support for people with eating disorders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Counselling\/therapy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therapy is highly necessary to treat an eating disorder. Since eating disorders lead to lots of irrational beliefs, working with a psychotherapist to therapeutically challenge those beliefs is a great step towards breaking their hold. A therapist can also work to unearth the underlying issues behind an eating disorder.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Nutritional counselling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to a \u201cnormal\u201d diet after an eating disorder can be distressing, and even dangerous. People with anorexia should not attempt to increase their intake of calories\u00a0 all at once. Speaking to a dietitian can help you figure out a sustainable meal plan that offers a well-balanced nutritional profile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Support groups<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with eating disorders, and their family members, often feel very alone. Support groups get rid of that notion. There are lots of other people in recovery who are experiencing the same thoughts and fears. It can be very validating to meet other people with eating disorders, as the general public cannot understand just how powerful an eating disorder can be. At the same time, it\u2019s a place to speak honestly, ask for help, and create social bonds to lean on through the recovery journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating disorders are complex, emotional illnesses. It\u2019s important to seek treatment from a professional to take the first step towards regaining true control over your life. You can speak to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\">psychotherapists<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dietitian\/\">dietitians<\/a> from the comfort of your home. Recovery is a long road, but it\u2019s a little easier when you have support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all have to eat, but some people develop unhealthy preoccupations with food and weight loss.
