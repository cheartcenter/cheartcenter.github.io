This can make opening your infant\u2019s diaper quite a shock. From broadcasting their diets, to alerting us to illness, our babies\u2019 poop tells us what\u2019s going on in their little bodies when they can\u2019t. But it helps to have a baby poop guide to know how to read the signs. We\u2019ve put together a baby poop primer to help you figure out what your baby\u2019s diaper is saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How often should my baby poop?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newborn poop frequency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a crucial predictor of overall health, especially in the first days after birth. Both breastfed and formula-fed babies should produce about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/grow13m.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six wet diapers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and one or more poops a day (once your milk comes in if you\u2019re breastfeeding). For breastfed babies, this pattern typically continues until about the six week mark when colostrum disappears from your breastmilk entirely. At this stage, the rate of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d begins to vary widely; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.llli.org\/breastfeeding-info\/constipation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one poop a week<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can actually be normal for a breastfed baby at this point. As long as your baby is gaining weight and producing enough wet diapers, infrequent poops aren\u2019t usually something you need to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After your little one starts solids, you\u2019ll likely see a much higher number of poopy diapers. It\u2019s normal for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to start <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pooping a lot after starting solids<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as much more of what they eat is going undigested. Their bowel movements will also be much smellier, and are likely to change colour and consistency depending on which foods they\u2019ve eaten.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What does healthy baby poop look like?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy baby poop can vary in appearance. Again there\u2019s a wide range of \u201cnormal\u201d here. For formula-fed infants, it tends to be about the consistency of toothpaste and tan coloured. But it\u2019s also normal for a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formula fed baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to have <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">green poop<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breastfed babies typically produce mustard-yellow stool, about the same consistency as actual mustard. Breastfed <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often have <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">white curds in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poop<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well, making it look seedy. But depending on what else you give your baby, healthy poop can also be orange, red, green, brown, or even black \u2014 more on this below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A colour guide to baby poop<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black poop sounds like it would be cause for an instant trip to the hospital. But actually, this tarry, sticky substance is called \u201cmeconium,\u201d and all healthy babies produce it for the first few days after birth. Likewise, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dark green baby poop<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds. Often it just means your little one has been eating a lot of green things. Even if your baby hasn\u2019t been chowing down on chard and spinach recently, there\u2019s no need to panic. Iron supplements can also cause your little one to have green poop. Or, the dark green poop might appear as the in-between phase between meconium and \u201cnormal\u201d breast milk or formula poop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even red poop isn\u2019t always a cause for concern. It\u2019s likely the result of something baby has eaten (hello beets). <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/pain-during-breastfeeding-and-other-common-problems\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breastfeeding issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might also cause your baby to ingest blood from cracked nipples, which would show up as blood in their poop. There are times, however, when black or red poop can signal something more serious \u2014 we\u2019ll cover that in a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Frothy baby poop<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your baby will likely have frothy poop from time to time, but contrary to what the internet says, it usually doesn\u2019t denote an allergy or intolerance. So don\u2019t cut out dairy, or wheat, or caffeine just yet. In a breastfed baby, frothy poop likely means that your letdown \u2014 the way the milk comes out of your breast \u2014 is quite forceful in one or both of your breasts. The first milk your breasts produce is called foremilk, and it\u2019s usually <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.laleche.org.uk\/health-professionals\/fat-content-breastmilk-faqs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more watery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and higher in lactose than the fattier and thicker hind milk which follows. If you have an oversupply or a strong letdown, your baby often ends up with more of the foremilk and less of the fattier hind milk, especially in the first few weeks of breastfeeding. This can be hard on your little one\u2019s digestion and result in frothy poop. Chances are your body will figure out what your baby needs after the first few weeks of nursing. In the meantime, you can try expressing milk into a towel before nursing. Draining each breast before switching your baby to the other side will also help by limiting future oversupply. If you find that you\u2019re still having issues, speaking to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/lactation-specialist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lactation consultant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarely, green, frothy baby poop does signal an allergy \u2014 likely to cow\u2019s milk in your diet. It might also mean, however, that your baby is sick. If you\u2019re seeing green, frothy baby poop on a regular basis, it\u2019s a good idea to speak to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/pediatrics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pediatrician<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What causes mucus in baby stool?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poop with mucus<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s diaper can be alarming. Luckily this isn\u2019t always a cause for concern. It\u2019s common for infants and newborns to be congested in the winter months when the air is drier, or if they have a cold. Because young babies don\u2019t know how to blow their nose, they often end up swallowing a lot of mucus. Using saline and a mucus aspirator will help unblock their nose and get rid of much of the mucus in their poop. If your baby isn\u2019t congested, however, and mucus in their stool persists, alert your child\u2019s doctor and bring a sample dirty diaper to the appointment. Sometimes mucus is a sign of intestinal issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to worry<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s true that a wide range of baby poop colours are normal, there are some notable exceptions. White, grey, or very anemic, pale-looking poops might signal a serious issue with your child\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/conditions-and-diseases\/biliary-atresia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">liver<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And while black poop is expected for the first few days of baby\u2019s life, if it comes back, see a pediatrician immediately. In an older child, black poop can mean a serious internal stomach bleed. Similarly, if your baby\u2019s poop contains streaks of blood, you should contact their pediatrician. If their stool is hard and your little one frequently strains while pooping, it\u2019s likely due to constipation. Sometimes, however, it can be the result of an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/conditions\/a-z\/stools-blood-in\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diarrhea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s can also be quite serious. If your little one has had diarrhea for more than 24 hours, it\u2019s crucial to take them to a doctor. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diarrhea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are at high risk of dehydration. If your baby has diarrhea and has fewer than six wet diapers a day, a sunken fontanelle (the soft spot on their head), a fever or vomiting, seek emergency care immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paying attention to your child\u2019s diaper is a great way to monitor their health. Know the signs that can signal trouble, but also keep in mind that food is the most likely culprit of funny coloured baby poop. So always make sure to check and if you don\u2019t know, don\u2019t be afraid to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baby poop is weird and colourful and changes often.
