Wherever you are\u00a0in the process, Health Canada has just released its new food guide to help us live a healthier lifestyle. This version, however, is a big departure from the versions of old. And the differences are in more than just appearance. Not only does this one not look like the one you remember, the advice it gives is radically\u00a0different too. Let\u2019s take a\u00a0look at the top five differences.<\/p>\n<h3>1. \u201cHealthy eating is more than the foods you eat\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>With that one line, the landing page of the new guide really sums up the ethos of the whole thing. Health Canada wants you to pay attention to who you eat with, where you eat and when you eat \u2014 not just what you eat. And if you stop and think about that for a moment, that really makes sense. They\u2019re asking you to pay attention to the circumstances under which you eat. There\u2019s been such a focus on mindfulness recently that it makes sense to extend it to our eating habits. Are you really hungry \u2014 or are you eating out of boredom or habit? Does your microwave dinner even taste good \u2014 or would you really prefer a nice homemade chili? Your preferences might surprise you if you start to\u00a0pay attention.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/posteverything\/wp\/2015\/01\/12\/the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-with-your-kids-eat-dinner-with-them\/?utm_term=.a6d7c74cef5e\">Much research<\/a>\u00a0has been done on the link between student success, positive development and how many meals a child eats a week with their family. Meals are a time to come together to process our days and discuss our thoughts, and to bond. Not just to blithely shovel food into our mouths in front of the television.<\/p>\n<h3>2. They want you to drink water, water and more water<\/h3>\n<p>This one makes intuitive sense to many of us already. We know sodas and other sugary drinks are huge contributors to things like obesity and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/healthy-drinks\/soft-drinks-and-disease\/\">type 2 diabetes<\/a>, so why not cut them out completely? Juice is nice from time to time, but really, isn\u2019t a piece of fruit just as good? Plus juice lacks the fibre found in fruit \u2014 fibre that helps with digestion and makes us feel full. And nothing quenches thirst the way water does. They want you to drink water so badly they\u2019ve suggested a range of fruits and herbs to flavour it with. And while they\u2019re still including milk in the \u201cother healthy drinks\u201d category, gone are the previous recommendation of two daily glasses.<\/p>\n<h3>3. There are no more food groups<\/h3>\n<p>That\u2019s right. No more \u201cmeat and meat alternatives,\u201d no more \u201cmilk and milk alternatives.\u201d The guide instead recommends you choose from three categories: whole grain foods, vegetables and fruits, and protein foods. Health Canada wants us to focus on healthy eating patterns, by which they mean eating mostly plant-based foods and limiting processed food. They even offer sample recipes. And there\u2019s no pressure to eat a specific number of servings from each category. Which leads us to the next big difference&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>4. There are no more recommended serving amounts<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but this one got me excited. The old system of serving sizes was confusing. Six to eight servings of grain products might sound straightforward, but some of us might have been interpreting that wrongly. Something tells us that Health Canada didn\u2019t intend that as a go-ahead to eat half a dozen bagels a day.<\/p>\n<p>So how many servings of grains can we have a day? Who knows?! The recommended food servings portion has been completely gutted. The new guide simply states that when it comes to fruits and vegetables, we should be eating \u201cplenty.\u201d They recommend protein foods as well, but no amount. And while they would like you to \u201cchoose whole grains,\u201d they don\u2019t specify the number of servings of those either. The landing page does contain a plate divided into three categories \u2014\u00a0one quarter protein, one quarter whole grain and half fruits and veggies \u2014 but the guide doesn\u2019t explicitly say that this is how you should be breaking down each meal. So go ahead and listen to your body and stop when you\u2019re full.<\/p>\n<h3>5. There\u2019s a focus on eating plant-based proteins<\/h3>\n<p>The guide is explicit in this, stating that we should choose plant-based protein more often. While the old guide did include legumes, tofu and nuts as alternative protein sources, the category was called \u201cmeat and <em>meat alternatives<\/em>\u201d after all. This time chicken, fish and meat, aren\u2019t taking centre stage. And the suggested recipes are split pretty evenly between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options (though there is a recipe for moose stew!).<\/p>\n<p>This is a big deal. There were no real guidelines on living a healthy vegetarian diet in the old guide, let alone a vegan one. Meatless Mondays have been popular for a while now, and vegetarian and vegan lifestyles are no longer seen as being fringe or marginal. And with reports on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2018\/may\/31\/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">high environmental costs<\/a> of meat production, it seems like the food guide is responding to the growing shifts in attitude. There\u2019s even a blurb on food waste.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious that the new food guide is a completely different animal than its predecessor. Health Canada seems to be challenging many of us to relearn the patterns that we\u2019ve fallen into over the years. From paying attention to where we\u2019re eating to entreating us to cook more often, the new food guide wants us to focus on more than just the food we eat, to help us live a healthier lifestyle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Health Canada just released the newest version of their food guide.
