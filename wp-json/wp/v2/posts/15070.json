Despite how common PCOS is, it\u2019s widely misunderstood. That might be because PCOS presents differently across patients. There\u2019s a constellation of possible symptoms you can experience, making this syndrome hard to predict and diagnose.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS patients can be treated by endocrinologists \u2014 doctors who specialize in hormone disorders \u2014 as well as family doctors or gynecologists. The glands in your body that secrete hormones make up your endocrine system. And what are hormones? They&#8217;re chemical messengers that communicate between your organs and tissues. They\u2019re vital for bodily functions like digestion, metabolism, and reproduction. When your hormones are out of imbalance there be ripple effects all throughout your body.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is polycystic ovary syndrome?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS is a hormone imbalance where people with female reproductive systems have higher than normal levels of androgens, a group of hormones that fuel male characteristics. In teenage boys, androgens drive changes like facial hair growth, deeper voice tenor, and broadening of shoulders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the name &#8220;polycystic ovary syndrome&#8221;, you\u2019d be justified in thinking that the hormone imbalance stems from cysts on your ovaries. But, you don\u2019t need to have ovarian cysts to have PCOS. If you match other signs, like biochemical or clinical criteria we explain further below, the diagnosis may be confirmed whether you have cysts or not.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do women have male hormones? Healthy ovaries naturally produce a small amount of androgens, as do your adrenal glands. With PCOS, your ovaries and adrenal glands produce higher levels of androgens. The increase in androgens can cause physical symptoms like increased body hair growth, menstrual irregularity, and acne. PCOS and it\u2019s complications can also lead to future health problems like diabetes and heart disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causes PCOS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.endocrineweb.com\/news\/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos\/59849-pcos-diet-its-about-managing-insulin-resistance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">called<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201ca collision between blood glucose regulation and reproductive hormones.\u201d For people who are insulin resistant, their bodies have a hard time using glucose efficiently. As a result, glucose builds up in their bloodstream and creates high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels increase the amount of androgens your body produces. The outcome? Hormonal imbalance, the hallmark of PCOS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being overweight is a risk factor for insulin resistance. But, even lean people who have PCOS usually test positive for insulin resistant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a patient is overweight, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weight loss for PCOS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may improve symptoms. Doctors recommend that patients think of weight loss from a lifestyle-based approach. Eating lots of whole plant foods, complex carbohydrates, and unsaturated fats is a good diet to improve insulin resistance. Low to moderate intensity exercise can also help you feel your best. Since PCOS is a lifelong condition, a healthy lifestyle will help manage symptoms long term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are well-documented contributors to PCOS, it\u2019s important to note that researchers haven\u2019t found a clear-cut cause. Genetics, lifestyle factors, inflammation, and insulin resistance are all associated. But, there\u2019s no way to tell for sure whether or not someone will develop PCOS. It\u2019s all down to your individual endocrine system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS signs and symptoms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several signs and symptoms that are often seen with PCOS. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irregular periods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of periods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased hair growth (hirsutism), typically on the face, chest, back, or buttocks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinning scalp hair<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oily skin or acne<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight gain, especially around the waist<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression, anxiety, and mood swings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Darkening of skin around the neck, groin, underarms, or skin folds <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(acanthosis nigricans)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased blood sugar<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty conceiving\/infertility<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the difference between an ovary with PCOS and a normal ovary?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, you don&#8217;t have to have ovarian cysts to qualify for PCOS. The reverse is also true. Having cysts on your ovaries doesn\u2019t automatically signify PCOS.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking at an ultrasound of a PCOS patient, and there are cysts present. One or both ovaries will contain small, immature ovarian follicles. These follicles will show up in medical imaging as cysts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-15099\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ultrasound of ovaries that have small cysts on them. \" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts-200x200.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pcos-cysts.jpg 313w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With PCOS, ovarian follicles stay in an immature state because of abnormal hormone levels present in the person\u2019s body. These follicles can&#8217;t grow to their fully matured state where an egg would normally be released. Instead, the immature follicles accumulate in the person\u2019s ovaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people have 12 or more cysts present in their ovaries. The good news is that the number of cysts you have tends to decrease with age. And, symptoms can often be improved through medical help and lifestyle adjustments.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS diagnosis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and treatment\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnosing PCOS is an inexact science. In fact, it\u2019s a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that doctors need to rule out all other possible causes for your symptoms before providing a PCOS diagnosis. There are no definitive tests that doctors can perform to absolutely confirm or deny that their patient has the syndrome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors diagnose PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria. If a patient has two out of three criteria present, a diagnosis of PCOS can be given.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rotterdam criteria are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irregular periods.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased androgen levels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cysts found on ovaries, confirmed by ultrasound.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some tests doctors rely on are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pelvic exams \u2014 a doctor visually or manually inspects their patient\u2019s reproductive area to check for noticeable cysts, growths, or other abnormalities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blood tests \u2014 tests check for hormone levels, insulin resistance, and other markers like fasting cholesterol levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultrasound \u2014 a form of medical imaging that allows doctors to inspect the ovaries and uterine lining of their patient.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since PCOS is different for every patient, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also has to be individually targeted. Doctors will recommend different options to relieve their patient\u2019s symptoms and concerns. These options include:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medication\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there aren\u2019t specific <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS medications,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doctors will often prescribe what\u2019s most useful for treating your unique concerns. The combination birth control pill can help regulate your periods. If you\u2019re looking to remain fertile, your doctor might prescribe ovulation medications to help balance your hormones. Diabetes medications like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/medications\/metformin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">metformin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help with insulin resistance. And for hirsutism, a blood pressure medication called spironolactone can be prescribed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle changes\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since PCOS is linked to obesity and insulin resistance, improving these health markers can greatly reduce symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get pregnant with PCOS\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS is one of the most common causes of infertility since it disrupts normal reproductive system functioning. But, the vast majority of people with PCOS can get pregnant with proper treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A combination of fertility treatments and lifestyle adjustments will allow most people with PCOS to conceive. In rare cases, a patient may require more intensive fertility treatments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can PCOS go away after pregnancy?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS won\u2019t automatically go away after pregnancy if the underlying issues are still present. Plus, the arrival of a baby and the onset of breastfeeding can further alter a mother\u2019s hormone balance and add new stress to her life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS is a lifelong condition. It usually emerges around the time someone has their first period. If you\u2019re diagnosed with PCOS, you\u2019ll always need to manage the condition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get help for PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though PCOS is a common endocrine disorder, it\u2019s shrouded in mystery and misconceptions. Like with other chronic illnesses, its invisibility can make people with the condition feel alone. People with PCOS often feel like they have to handle the weight of regular life, plus their difficult symptoms at all times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to get medical help for PCOS if you suspect you have it. PCOS can lead to outcomes like diabetes and heart disease in the long run as well as endometriosis and an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/pcos\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20353439&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1599579667121000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrWSJQMLwJT7PDpNxqP4D7Rei-VA\">increased risk of endometrial cancer<\/a>. Plus, people who want to conceive will find it much easier to do so if they take steps to address their condition beforehand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get help for PCOS, talk to your doctor about your concerns. List the symptoms you\u2019ve been having, your medical history, and any medications you\u2019re currently or have recently been on. Keep a record of your menstrual cycle as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your doctor may recommend some of the tests mentioned earlier in this article. They may also refer you to an endocrinologist, who can give a more expert assessment of your hormone health. Referrals for a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS endocrinologist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may result in being put on a lengthy wait list.
