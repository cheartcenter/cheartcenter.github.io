Luckily, baby constipation is often easy to treat at home. But while some old-fashioned remedies work like a charm, there\u2019s also a lot of really bad advice out there. We\u2019ve got the goods on how to treat baby constipation safely and effectively, so you\u2019ll know when to head to the doctor and when you can treat it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Constipation in newborns<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constipation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formula-fed newborns<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more likely than in breastfed ones, but it can be an issue for both. Trying to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfed baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poop<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can drive you a little nuts. As crazy as it sounds, one poop a week can (in some cases) be normal for a breastfed baby. Confirm with your doctor if this is normal for your baby and if it is, your best bet is to let it go for a while. Their weekly poop will likely become more frequent once they start eating solids. If you\u2019re concerned that your formula-fed baby isn\u2019t going frequently enough, consider switching brands. It\u2019s possible that an ingredient in the formula is binding them up, and switching formulas might be enough to resolve the issue. Same thing if your little one has started on baby cereal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to help your newborn poop<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until they start solids, figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/a-parents-guide-to-baby-poop\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn poop<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easily<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a little tricky. For your baby\u2019s first six weeks, your breast milk contains <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.llli.org\/breastfeeding-info\/colostrum-general\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colostrum<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which has laxative properties, so generally, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues until this point. Once the colostrum peters out, however, some babies start to have issues. In this case, you can try giving them a warm bath to relax them, or placing them on all fours to help stimulate their sphincter. A gentle tummy <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">massage<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to relieve <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s constipation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might also help. If they continue to have issues, speak to their pediatrician for advice on what comes next \u2014 baby laxatives aren\u2019t always the best course of action.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby constipation after starting solids<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might make some little ones pass stool more frequently, many find their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">constipated after starting solids<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Bananas and dairy are well-known <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby-constipating foods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are best to avoid if your baby is struggling to poop regularly. But baby cereal is also a frequent culprit of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby constipation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Most doctors recommend sticking to fruits and veggies for your baby\u2019s first foods as they are high in fibre and easy to introduce one at a time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat baby constipation naturally<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your little one suffers from constipation regularly, there are a couple of natural fixes you can try at home. If you\u2019re trying to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to relieve constipation quickly in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your best bet is to start by giving them more fluids. Formula or breastmilk should be baby&#8217;s primary source of nutrition until at least a year, but once they start solids they can also have two or three ounces of water with meals (unless they\u2019re under six months). So-called \u201cp\u201d foods like pumpkin, peas and pears are great for easing constipation. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can also try adding flaxseed (ground or whole) to their purees. Flaxseed is high in both soluble and insoluble fibre and a little can go a long way. But be warned \u2014 flaxseed needs to be taken with a lot of water in order to work its magic. Otherwise it\u2019s liable to make the problem worse instead of better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What not to do<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> corn <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">syrup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">constipation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to be a popular home remedy. But today\u2019s corn syrups don\u2019t always have the same formulations, so there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be effective. Plus, corn syrup contains tons of sugar, which isn\u2019t good for babies, so you\u2019re better off skipping it entirely. Mineral oil is another internet constipation cure that\u2019s a definite no. Ingesting mineral oil can cause a variety of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2804525\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health complications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in babies and children, including death. And unless your doctor specifically recommends it, never insert a thermometer or anything else into your baby\u2019s bum \u2014 it can actually perforate their anus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat constipation in toddlers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constipated toddlers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are pretty common. At this stage they\u2019re eating tons of different things and food is often a culprit \u2014 especially if they\u2019re on the all-pasta toddler diet. But potty training can also cause your formerly regular toddler to struggle with constipation. Having more bowel control means kids can hold in their poop, which a surprising number do once potty training starts. If your toddler is struggling with constipation in spite of more fibre and water, it\u2019s worth speaking to their doctor about adding in a stool softener or a gentle laxative. Holding in poop isn\u2019t good for their body, and in extreme cases it can lead to encopresis (leaking poop). Whatever you do, don\u2019t get into a power struggle with your toddler over pooping in the toilet \u2014 they\u2019ll win every time. You\u2019re better off backing off and trying potty training again when they\u2019re ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to worry<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s constipated<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s hard not to be concerned that they\u2019re in pain. But you shouldn\u2019t worry unless your baby seems to be straining to pass a BM, their poop comes out as hard nuggets or they have blood in their poop. As well, if your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seems <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">constipated<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and isn\u2019t producing at least six wet diapers a day, you should consider that a medical emergency \u2014 it could mean that they\u2019re dehydrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies suffer from constipation just like adults, and like us, it\u2019s rarely indicative of a medical issue. Some babies can poop no matter what they eat, while others have digestive systems that are more sluggish. With a little patience and some help from mom or dad, things should start moving soon enough. But if you\u2019re ever in doubt, don\u2019t be afraid to seek medical attention.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baby constipation is a pretty common issue, but there&#8217;s a lot of bad advice out there on how to fix it.
