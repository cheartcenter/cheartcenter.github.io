There\u2019s a lot of information to process all at once, and it can be difficult to know where to start. Everyone reacts differently. Some people prefer to investigate their diagnosis, while others prefer to take in only need-to-know information and let their doctor do the rest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your preference, know that you\u2019ll be supported every step of the way. Your doctor, friends and family will be with you throughout your oncology treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the help of oncologist Dr Barrett, we\u2019ve put together some tips for navigating your diagnosis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand your situation is unique<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being diagnosed with cancer, it\u2019s understandable to want clarity about how things will unfold with your treatment. However, it can be complicated for your doctor to provide straight <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/ive-been-diagnosed-with-cancer-what-questions-should-i-ask\">answers to your questions<\/a>. This is because every cancer patient is unique, so your treatment plan needs to be unique as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your doctor will consider your current health, medical history and any risk factors you might have. Then, they examine the type of cancer you have. Where your cancer is located, what stage it is, and how fast it\u2019s spreading are all important details for creating a treatment plan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, your doctor will lay out your treatment plan, taking all of the above factors into consideration. They might suggest surgery, medical oncology (medication), radiation, or a combination of the three.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because your cancer is unique, it can be tricky to obtain highly personalized treatments. You might want to research what clinical trials are underway. Clinical trials look at targeting very specific types of cancer, but not every trial is available to each hospital. You can ask your doctor what clinical trials are taking place at your treatment center, or search the web for trials that are taking place elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some good resources for looking into clinical trials are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com\/en-us\/patient?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%20cancer%20%20clinical%20%20trials&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=ad10&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjsn9gq_K6AIVhqDsCh15RgbUEAAYAyAAEgLRp_D_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merck Oncology Clinical Trials<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/diagnosis-and-treatment\/clinical-trials\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Cancer Society<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, you play a big role in choosing your treatment plan. Some patients prefer less invasive therapies that are less aggressive on their cancer. Some patients want to explore all of their options. It\u2019s really up to you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seek credible information sources<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researching your diagnosis online is a touchy subject \u2014 since cancer is so individual, the information you find on the internet might not apply to your case. There\u2019s also a lot of dubious information on the net. If you want to research your diagnosis, here are some credible sources to turn to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/resources-for\/hp\/education\/cancer-patient-education-resource\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer.gov<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.net\/patient-education-resources\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer.net<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdanderson.org\/patients-family\/diagnosis-treatment\/cancer-types.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MD Anderson<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uhn.ca\/PrincessMargaret\/PatientsFamilies\/Patient_Family_Library\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Princess Margaret Hospital<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.albertahealthservices.ca\/cancer\/Page16299.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alberta Health Services<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bccancer.bc.ca\/our-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BC Cancer<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep up your strength<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s great to be proactive leading up to your oncology treatment. Staying strong and healthy will make treatment easier, and can have a great impact on your outcome.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on your holistic health \u2014 your body and mind are both important. Try to maintain a hopeful, positive mindset. Having a positive outlook never made a situation worse, and you\u2019ll carry a strong, determined mindset throughout your treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time for mental practices such as meditation, yoga and any religious or spiritual practices you follow. You can also do light physical activity depending on your health and previous fitness levels. Taking walks, gentle jogging, and even physiotherapy can help you feel better and keep your strength levels up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to fuel your body, too. Cancer treatment puts stress on your body, so the food you eat will play a big part in how you recover during your downtime. Choose healthy foods that contain vitamins, protein and electrolytes. These foods will also boost your immune system.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep is essential for keeping up your strength. When you sleep, your body does it\u2019s work to recover from the previous day\u2019s stresses. Try to get 7-9 hours of good quality sleep each night.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calm your emotions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer treatment can be a very scary thing, especially in the early days. You\u2019re going down a road you never expected to, and experiencing a lot of change. It\u2019s understandable to be afraid, and to feel lonely in this new reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as you can, try to find happiness and relaxation in your daily life. Doing so will lower your body\u2019s stress levels, which can be hugely beneficial as you proceed through your cancer treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about what makes you happiest. Is it seeing your family? Playing an instrument? Photography? Whatever activity brings you joy, find a way to incorporate it into your life on a more frequent basis. This will transport your mind away from stressful thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take comfort in the fact that there\u2019s lots of support resources available. There are online forums, books, and digital health platforms to draw from. You might find comfort in speaking to your doctor about your concerns. Your doctor is highly experienced in treating cancer, and can give you knowledgeable words of wisdom.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of cancer patients are amazed at how their friends and family go out of their way to be supportive. Your social network will be a pillar of strength through your treatment. Keep in mind all the people who love and support you \u2014 you\u2019re not alone in this journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find balance between work, life and treatment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the big changes that comes with a cancer diagnosis is the possibility of leaving your job. On one hand, your job can provide a sense of normalcy in your life. On the other, it can be stressful and drain your energy. So, should you keep working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since every person\u2019s diagnosis is so individual, the decision to leave or stay at work is completely up to you. Consider your diagnosis, your energy levels, your current state of health and the nature of your work. Do you enjoy your work, and are you able to carry on at your job without becoming drained? If yes, you might choose to keep working for the time being.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to keep working, let your employer know about your diagnosis as soon as possible. They can make accommodations for you, and will be flexible if you decide you need to take some time off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your job doesn\u2019t align with your self-care and treatment, you should feel empowered to leave. Your patient navigator can help you with structuring a new lifestyle that revolves around staying strong and healthy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer treatments can take months or even years, so it\u2019s not realistic to put everything you love on hold for such a long period of time. If you have activities you enjoy like pilates, seeing your grandchildren or volunteering, keep going with them. They\u2019ll improve your state of mind and keep you connected with your normal life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to find the silver lining in a cancer diagnosis. Suddenly you\u2019re required to change your life, digest new information and find immense inner-strength. How you choose to navigate your treatment is up to you. Maybe you want as much information as you can get, or maybe you\u2019d prefer not to delve into the specifics. Whatever you choose, there\u2019s support available for you. By asking the right questions, taking care of yourself and enlisting friends and family to stand by, you can navigate your cancer treatment with strength and positivity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Receiving a cancer diagnosis is life-altering.
