Aren\u2019t you supposed to have grown out of it by now?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although acne is thought of as a teenage experience, a huge number of adults deal with acne too. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1L-b5AeOya2hDnFSe_KVSvG1PUllOOkCVSymoeH8xCs0\/edit?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study found<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that 15% of men and 85% of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">women involved had adult acne.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This nagging skin condition can leave you searching for the holy grail of products, treatments, and regimens. But what actually <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causes adult acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Is it something you\u2019ll have to live with forever, or is there a solution that actually works?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start out by defining acne. Acne is the term for when your pores and hair follicles get clogged with bacteria, resulting in pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, and cysts. Nearly all acne you get in your adult years is caused by inflammation and clogged pores.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several causes for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, some of which are simply out of your control. This makes it tricky to pinpoint the exact cause of your acne. We\u2019ve laid out some of the most common causes of adult acne below. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Hormones<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re a teen or an adult, hormones are the main culprit behind acne. When you\u2019re a teenager, puberty causes increased levels of androgens. As an adult, the hormonal reasons behind acne are different.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In women, premenstrual syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">menopause contribute to adult acne.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The fluctuations in hormone levels that each event brings is the trigger. These fluctuations can result in increased sebum production in your skin\u2019s oil glands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men also go through hormonal shifts over the years. At around age 50, some men experience andropause, where testosterone levels dip. Too much testosterone can cause <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne in men<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some men are genetically predisposed to having higher than usual testosterone levels. Elevated levels can also be caused by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.everlywell.com\/discover\/unhealthy-testosterone-levels-in-men\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testicular or adrenal tumours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Contact irritation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our skin is protected by a moisture barrier, also known as the acid mantle. The moisture barrier is made up of sebum and controls the pH level of your facial skin. It prevents dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants from penetrating your skin. And, it locks in moisture, helping your skin stay healthy and bouncy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many things in your daily life can aggravate your skin\u2019s moisture barrier. Harsh cleansers, scrubs, razors, fragrances, and even detergents from your clothing can irritate your skin. If you\u2019re finding your skin is sensitive, it might be worth it to switch to fragrance-free soaps and to stop exfoliating for a while.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Skin-clogging products<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, simpler is better for your skin. Many facial moisturizers, makeup products, sunscreens, and hair <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">products contribute to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Adult <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chin or forehead acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be caused by pore-clogging ingredients in an everyday product. If it\u2019s happening to you, consider using something with a short list of straightforward ingredients instead. As well, some cosmetics such as foundation and powder layer over your pores and can become contaminated with bacteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Picking<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have a pimple on your face, it can drive you a bit crazy. Every time you pass a mirror it\u2019s all you see. That\u2019s when your hands might unconsciously travel to your face, and start squeezing at the offending zit. Pump the brakes! Picking at your pimples only drives bacteria further down the pore, and drastically increases your chances of developing acne scars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If taken too far, squeezing your zits can turn into excoriation disorder. People with this disorder often have very pronounced lesions and scarring from picking their face relentlessly. It\u2019s better to keep your hands off your face, and let your skin clear up on it\u2019s own.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not much help to say \u201cavoid stress.\u201d Stress is a fact of life, especially when you\u2019re an adult with bills to pay and a family to take care of. The key is to find ways to manage your stress levels. Stress can mess with your skin by increasing levels of a hormone called cortisol, which is involved in your \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. Your skin\u2019s oil glands have cortisol receptors, and produce more sebum when they\u2019re activated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Diet<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big aspect of acne is general inflammation levels throughout your body. Diet directly impacts this. Western diet, with lots of omega-6 fatty acids and refined sugar, can cause chronic inflammation. Admittedly, there\u2019s controversy over whether the role of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diet in causing adult<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acne is overhyped. Some people break out reliably when they eat fried or sugary foods, while other people see no effect no matter what they eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Medication<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some medications have a tendency to cause acne. These medications include corticosteroids, antidepressants, and epilepsy treatments. Some hormonal contraceptive methods are also known to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trigger acne in adults<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Caring for acne at home<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, now we know some of the main causes of adult acne. Let\u2019s talk about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne treatments<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to reducing incidental <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne is a good skincare<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> routine. Following smart skin practices to reduce incidental acne:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash your face twice daily with mild water and a gentle<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">face wash compatible with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adult acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a gentle, fragrance-free facial moisturizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exfoliate with acids, not scrubs. You can use lactic, salicylic, glycolic, or fruit acids to name a few.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove your makeup every night before bed.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use non comedogenic skincare products, makeup, sunscreen, and hair products. These are less likely to clog your pores.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See a dermatologist to get a professional read on your skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have more stubborn acne that won\u2019t budge with self-treatment, it\u2019s extremely helpful to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\">see a dermatologist<\/a>.

Some common treatments include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light therapy, such as photodynamic therapy.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chemical peels.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDrainage and extraction,\u201d where the dermatologists manually extracts pimples.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steroid injection for cystic acne.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prescription of topical or oral medication for acne in adults.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting adult acne can be frustrating, but the good news is that it\u2019s usually very treatable.
