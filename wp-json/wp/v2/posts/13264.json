After all, no one wants to bring their baggage to work. However, employees are human beings, prone to physical and mental stress. Despite their best attempts, many employees carry the weight of their mental health alongside their work responsibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanofi.ca\/en\/products-and-resources\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Sanofi Canada Healthcare Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0shone a light on a worrying trend.

Mental stress is a major cause of worker absenteeism, job turnover, and dented company morale. It can also exacerbate pre-existing employee mental health conditions. Unfortunately, mental illness is largely invisible, and highly stigmatized.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The causes of mental stress amongst young people are complex and impossible to generalize across entire generations. Blanket statements that younger generations are \u201clazy\u201d or \u201csnowflakes\u201d downplay the very real experience of mental illness. These statements also send the message that someone who is struggling will be judged for seeking help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasons for stress amongst younger workers<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finance\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young workers have never known the economic landscape to be anything but volatile. They entered the workforce on the heels of the Great Recession, saddled with student loans, and balancing stagnant wages with skyrocketing real estate prices. Since 1996, the millennial age segment has\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/average-american-millennial-net-worth-student-loan-debt-savings-habits-2019-6#and-the-typical-millennial-has-less-than-5000-in-their-savings-account-3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decreased in net worth by 34%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work-life balance<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young people are well-known for having different values than older generations. They tend to desire experiences and human connections over physical assets. They\u2019ve also developed a different relationship with work. To millennials and Gen Z, a job is a thing, not a place. If technology enables them to perform their job from anywhere, why be tethered to an office?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When young workers ask for work-life balance, there is often fear of blowback. \u201cWhen younger workers talk about balance, what they are saying is, \u2018I will work hard for you, but I also need a life,\u2019\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/09\/17\/style\/generation-z-millennials-work-life-balance.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said Cali Williams Yost<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the chief executive and founder of Flex Strategy Group. \u201cUnfortunately, what leaders hear is, \u2018I want to work less.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there\u2019s a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2019\/2\/20\/18210498\/smartphones-tech-social-media-teens-depression-anxiety-research\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lack of causal data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to link technology and social media usage with mental illness, there does seem to be a correlation. Younger people are known to be open-minded and adept at using technology. However technology does have the potential to become a dependency, leading to FOMO (fear of missing out), lowered self-esteem, and a distorted perception of reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young people\u2019s tight-knit relationship with technology also interrupts work-life balance. Being tied to their devices, employees are notified of every email, message, and project update the moment it happens. While technology has enabled us to become more connected, it\u2019s difficult to sever that tie outside of business hours. In some cases, the expectation is raised that employees should be available round-the-clock, since they\u2019re on their devices anyways.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitive pressures in the workforce<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word \u201ccareer\u201d has shifted in meaning to young workers. The rise of non-standard jobs, such as those in the gig economy, technically <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gigeconomydata.org\/basics\/who-participates-gig-economy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employ many young people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, these jobs come with little longevity or safety net.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even amongst office jobs, the idea of staying with one company for a lifetime is off the table for most young workers. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/better\/business\/job-hopping-rise-should-you-consider-switching-roles-make-more-ncna868641\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People change jobs much more frequently<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the current age than in decades past.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased mental health acceptance<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millenials have been tagged the \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/millennials-are-the-therapy-generation-11551452286\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">therapy generation.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d While the nickname may be tongue-in-cheek, millennials at large will not deny that they endorse therapy.

As a result, millennials and Gen Z <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/graziadaily.co.uk\/life\/opinion\/millennials-became-generation-therapy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may not feel the need<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to put on a \u201cbrave face\u201d the way that older, more stoic colleagues might.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to alleviate workplace stress for millennials and Gen Z<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Examine workplace stressors<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main sources of workplace stress reported in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanofi.ca\/en\/products-and-resources\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanofi Canada Healthcare Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are personal finances, workload, work-life balance, interactions with co-workers, and personal relationships.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies promote an inclusive culture manifesto, but it\u2019s difficult to put those words into action. Employers should take \u201cevery reasonable precaution\u201d to ensure the health and safety of all their employees as per their province\u2019s health and safety act. This includes maintaining a workplace culture that is conducive to mental health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can employers do if they find their culture becoming demoralized or toxic to mental health? \u201cLeadership sets the tone of the workplace culture and acceptable behavior patterns,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90234968\/how-to-fix-your-toxic-culture\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says Shahnaz Broucek<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a professor of coaching and mentoring for MBA students at the University of Michigan. \u201cConflict avoidance, chronic stress, and office politics can lead distracted leaders to unconsciously allow negative behaviours like bullying to poison the well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step to fixing a negative culture is for leadership to accept responsibility for the situation. Then, perform analysis to find the pain points. Take an impartial look at office interactions, and use the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindtools.com\/pages\/article\/SCARF.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SCARF<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> model to identify culture problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>The SCARF model<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status \u2014 higher status employees who wield power over more junior staff, and undermine them publicly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainty \u2014 employees who act as information gatekeepers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autonomy \u2014 micromanaging projects and undermining the personal agency of employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relatedness \u2014 clique formation, ostracizing select employees, and implying they are replaceable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fairness \u2014 decisions that are made with little or no transparency into their rationale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this checklist, compile the results and look for any patterns. If the SCARF model flags issues in a particular area, minimize risks and maximize rewards. For example, someone might become defensive when receiving feedback. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindtools.com\/pages\/article\/SCARF.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SCARF<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> model suggests adjusting the tone of feedback to help employees feel less at risk in their jobs, while distributing more public praise as a reward. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindtools.com\/pages\/article\/SCARF.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here to find a full breakdown of the SCARF model<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Incorporate mental health services into benefit plans<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One in five<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadians will experience mental illness each year, but cost and scheduling prevent many people from seeking therapy. Employees who are experiencing mental stress or illness are prone to leaving work early, taking emergency days off, or leaving their job entirely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help employees deal with the stresses of work and life by adding therapy to their benefit plans. Many employers who already offer this paramedical benefit are planning to increase maximum spends. Employees can look for local in person therapy options, or seek treatment online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of virtual therapy include no commute times, 24\/7 scheduling, and a wide range of available specialists. For patients who are dealing with anxiety or depression, the ability to stay comfortable at home is an added bonus. Work-life balance is maintained since patients can seek therapy at whatever time is convenient for them, with no need to travel to a clinic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sanofi survey specifically notes internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) as a growing trend. Companies who make iCBT available report shorter leaves of absence for employees experiencing mental stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Mandate mental health training for people managers<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While people managers are technically employees themselves, they share their employer\u2019s responsibility to create a psychologically safe work environment. It\u2019s a good idea for managers to undergo mental health awareness training when they ascend to the level of overseeing junior staff.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many organizations that provide this type of managerial training. Mental health training sessions typically include the following curriculum:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Training to dispel mental health myths and stigma.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self assessment techniques.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to make the workplace accommodating.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize changes in employee mental health.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to take action if an employee is struggling.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips for talking about mental health.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Provide mentorship<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentorship is about more than forming connections and advancing in your career. It\u2019s also about feeling supported and secure in your job. Companies that set up mentorship programs receive more educated, motivated employees, and see their culture improve from increased collaboration and communication.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Create an open-dialogue culture<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final blow to workplace culture is when employees stop speaking openly and honestly. To prevent this breakdown of communication, let employees know that talking about and seeking help for mental health is encouraged.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about mental health reduces its stigma, and can provide a lifeline for employees who are struggling more than they openly let on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why are younger employees so stressed? There are certain generational stressors, but it\u2019s important to remember that each person is an individual. It\u2019s the employer\u2019s responsibility to create a psychologically safe workplace which entails examining culture, providing mental health benefits, and fostering an open-dialogue. With these steps in place, millennials, Gen X, baby boomers, and the incoming Gen Z can all work harmoniously and productively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in adding virtual care to your employee benefit plans, or want more information about virtual therapy options, please get in touch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanofi.ca\/en\/products-and-resources\/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 The 2020 Sanofi Canada Healthcare Survey<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Workers in the 18-34 age range report greater workplace stress than older colleagues.
