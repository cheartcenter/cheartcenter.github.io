With COVID-19 numbers rising, and cold temperatures making the outside world inhospitable, we\u2019ll be spending lots of time inside. This is especially tough on those of us who experience seasonal affective disorder. It can feel like we\u2019re way too cooped up, even though we know it\u2019s for the best.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The winter season should be a time of joy, but we have to be careful to take care of ourselves for the sake of our families and communities. Check out our tips to keep up your mental and physical health all winter long.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tackle stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Chronic<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Mental-Health-treatment\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stress<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/health.clevelandclinic.org\/what-happens-when-your-immune-system-gets-stressed-out\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower immune functioning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making us an easier target for diseases like the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/flu-treatment\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Grocery delivery services are a convenient way to save some effort and hours. If you\u2019re struggling with workload at your job, have a transparent conversation with your boss about your mental state. Most companies have COVID-19 policies in place to be compassionate to their staff\u2019s needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get plenty of sleep. This can sound more like an item on your wish list than a real possibility but give it a try! Our bodies need <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-importance-of-sleep-are-you-really-getting-enough\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven to nine hours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of sleep a night to recharge and stay healthy. If you have kids, try alternating early morning wake-ups with your partner so you each have a day to sleep in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Get outside<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter can be fun if you embrace whimsical outdoor activities. A nice, socially-distanced winter hike is very clearing for the mind. If you have access to a lake, ice-skating is a picturesque Canadian staple. What about your own backyard? Challenge your family members to a snowball fight, or make a snowman together. Putting on winter gear and playing in the snow is a great way to get active.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Curb the overindulging<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/womens-health\/belly-fat-may-pose-more-danger-for-women-than-for-men\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excess belly fat<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can increase your risk of developing a host of health problems like heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Sitting around bored, surrounded by snacks is a sure-fire way to end up overeating. So, schedule a daily walk to get a break from munching and to get your limbs moving.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a glass of water before you unwrap a snack can also help stop you eating too much \u2014 it will keep you from confusing thirst with hunger. And make sure you have some favourite healthy options on hand for those times when you really need a snack.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Look at your sunshine and vitamin D intake<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d our body produces vitamin D when we are exposed to sunlight. As Canadians, we usually <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-624-x\/2013001\/article\/11727-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t get enough sun<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the winter to make the vitamin D we need. Low levels of Vitamin D are linked to higher rates of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2908269\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/osteoporosis.ca\/bone-health-osteoporosis\/calcium-and-vitamin-d\/vitamin-d\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">osteoporosis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so it\u2019s worth talking to your doctor about whether you should be taking a Vitamin D supplement, especially in the winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice proper hygiene<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being cooped up indoors with family and friends is a great way to spread germs. There\u2019s a reason colds and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/flu-treatment\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> peak during the coldest months &#8212; they have their pick of hosts! It sounds simple, but practice proper hygiene by washing your hands regularly. Doing it before and after cooking and as soon as you get home helps to stop the spread of germs. And be mindful of touching communal surfaces like elevator buttons or subway poles and then touching your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Get your flu shot<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a critical year to get your flu shot. You can get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time, which is a terrible combo. Plus, the seasonal flu puts many people in the hospital annually. We need to reserve some hospital beds for COVID-19 patients to avoid overwhelming our healthcare system. So, take a precautionary step in keeping yourself healthy by getting the flu shot.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Keep up COVID-19 measures<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been a long road so far in battling COVID-19, and it\u2019s unfortunately not over. Many of us are looking forward to 2021 as a harbinger of better times, but the stroke of midnight on New Year\u2019s won\u2019t do anything for public health. We have to keep up measures to flatten the curve, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing a mask in public.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolating ourselves if we test positive to COVID-19, or have symptoms.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequent hand washing and sanitizing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding unnecessary travel.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only leaving home for essential trips.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid19\/\">Click here to visit our COVID-19 resource centre<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Know when to see a doctor<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter colds can be unpleasant, but the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/flu-treatment\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be serious \u2014 even life-threatening for some people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re not likely to have a fever or chills with a cold \u2014 those can be signs that it\u2019s something worse like the flu. If you think you\u2019re getting the flu, speak to a doctor within the first 48 hours of exhibiting symptoms. During that time, doctors can prescribe an antiviral like Tamiflu, which can drastically reduce your recovery time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you experience a high fever for more than three days or chest pain or shortness of breath with the flu, you should seek urgent medical advice. Flu can be more dangerous in little ones. If your child has the flu and isn\u2019t eating or drinking or isn\u2019t waking up easily, contact a doctor immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It may be the most wonderful time of the year, but we&#8217;re also more likely to get sick once winter hits.
