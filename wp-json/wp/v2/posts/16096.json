My hair is falling out!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, you\u2019ve noticed more hair in the sink while getting ready in the morning. Or maybe you caught a glimpse of your hairline in the rearview mirror and found it sitting a little further back than before.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the thing. So long as there aren\u2019t any adverse side-effects, balding is normal and a natural sign of aging. 80% of men <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dermatology.ca\/public-patients\/hair\/alopecia\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experience some balding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the age of 70 while 40% of women experience hair thinning by age 50.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, society puts a lot of pressure on us to look a certain way. It\u2019s why balding is sometimes accompanied by social isolation, self-consciousness, and depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever approach you choose to address balding \u2014 whether it\u2019s using a safe option to reverse it or embracing the change \u2014 we\u2019re here to help you with the information you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your balding due to an underlying health condition?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you only recently noticed signs of balding? Before you can select a strategy, it\u2019s important to identify what type of balding you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balding can be caused by factors such as a thyroid imbalance, childbirth, surgery, or vitamin deficiencies. Your doctor can help identify if there are health reasons for your hair loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you rule out underlying conditions, there\u2019s a good chance that your doctor will diagnose you with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nyulangone.org\/conditions\/hair-loss\/types\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">androgenic alopecia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is a genetic cause of balding that occurs in both men and women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For men with androgenic alopecia, a receding hairline that creates an \u201cM\u201d shape is the most common sign. For women, hair usually thins around the entire head.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you slow down or reverse your balding?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can, but results may vary. The effectiveness depends on the underlying cause of your hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, androgenic alopecia is genetic and can be slowed down, but not reversed without surgery. On the other hand, balding caused by underlying medical issues can usually be reversed by treating the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have androgenic alopecia, here are a few options to slow the process down.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogaine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minoxidil, commonly referred to as Rogaine, is a popular option for slowing hair loss caused by androgenic alopecia. It\u2019s an over-the-counter solution that restores idle hair follicles when applied. Rogaine is mostly taken by women since it\u2019s more effective for tackling overall hair thinning instead of a receding hairline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-level light therapy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red light therapy, also known as low-level light therapy, directs photons towards weak hair follicles in the tissue of your scalp. The photons are then absorbed to stimulate hair growth. Generally, light therapy is considered safer and less intrusive than surgical procedures like hair transplants. Notably, this method is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3944668\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more suitable for early stage hair loss as opposed to late stage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hair loss.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results vary from person to person, but when laser solutions work, people observe healthier, thicker hair in about half a year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most appealing aspects is the availability of a low cost alternative. Low-level light therapy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/skin-problems-and-treatments\/hair-loss\/qa\/how-effective-is-lowlevel-laser-therapy-lllt-in-treating-hair-loss\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be done in the comfort of your own home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without a doctors\u2019 appointment, and takes approximately 15 minutes per session.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hair transplants <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to reverse hair loss rather than slow it down, a hair transplant may be what you\u2019re after. Hair follicles from other parts of your body are placed on balding areas of your head, allowing for new hair growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The procedure <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/skin-problems-and-treatments\/hair-loss\/men-hair-loss-17\/hair-transplants\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lasts about 4-8 hours<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and costs about $4000 to $15,000. Afterwards, your scalp may be tender for a few days. You\u2019ll be able to resume normal activities 2-5 days after the surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This procedure is helpful for baldness due to injuries as well as androgenic alopecia.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platelet rich plasma treatments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/treatment-tests-and-therapies\/plateletrich-plasma-prp-treatment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platelet rich plasma treatments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also known as PRP treatments, are another option for slowing down hair loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiny blood cells called platelets contain growth factors that can encourage the growth of existing hair. They can even be used alongside a hair transplant to strengthen the growth of the transplanted hair follicles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the procedure, doctors draw blood from your arm so that they can isolate the PRP. Then they numb the thinning spots on your scalp and inject iPRP to stimulate hair growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire process only takes about 30 minutes. With the exception of light bruising and a hold on washing the affected areas for 48 hours, patients can continue with their daily lives as usual.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prescription medicine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medication is also an option, but it\u2019s important to have a thorough conversation with your doctor before starting any treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers have observed that Finasteride, a medication popularly used by men, reduced balding in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/9951956\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">83% of men who\u00a0 applied it regularly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, researchers at John Hopkins University have found that Finasteride may <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/brady-urology-institute\/specialties\/conditions-and-treatments\/prostate-cancer\/prostate-cancer-questions\/finasteride-are-the-risks-worth-it\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make it harder to diagnose patients with prostate cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women may be prescribed anti-androgen medications such as spironolactone in order to reduce their hair loss. These are highly effective as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2684510\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most female cases of pattern baldness are androgen dependent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embracing hair loss<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not interested in reversing hair loss but you\u2019re still struggling with the change, here are a few things to keep in mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, hair loss is not life threatening. So long as you\u2019ve ruled out any underlying conditions, you\u2019re perfectly healthy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, your hair is not the only appealing thing about you. Your personality, talents, and attitude towards others are what\u2019s important. This may seem like small comfort at first, but it\u2019s a reminder that hair loss should not affect how you move through the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, embracing hair loss doesn\u2019t mean accelerating hair loss. A great stylist can give you a haircut that works with your current hair thickness, or even help you learn how to incorporate wigs into your personal style. If you want to talk to a doctor or dermatologist about your treatment options, you can speak to one online from the comfort of your home. Whether you want to keep your dreams of luscious hair, or plan to embrace your scalp in any state, there are options to support your choice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you notice your hairline looking a little thinner, the change can be distressing.
