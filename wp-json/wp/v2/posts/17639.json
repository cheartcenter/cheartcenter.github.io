A structured schedule with a predictable order of operations is reassuring and can even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10802-010-9447-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lessen behavioural issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in children. So whether they\u2019re three years old or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two months<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, having a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby routine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is key. It\u2019s also a crucial part of sleep hygiene \u2014 and not just for babies. So if you\u2019re wondering how, when and whether you should schedule your little one\u2019s day, you\u2019ve come to the right place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should I start my newborn on a schedule?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A baby routine is hard to come by in the first months. From about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1-3 months<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s routine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just developing and they\u2019ll likely sleep and eat at will instead of on a schedule. It\u2019s not really worth looking up an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">example<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn routine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because they\u2019re not likely to keep to one until they\u2019re a little older. Newborns can\u2019t really stay awake for longer than 45 minutes to an hour and they frequently fall asleep nursing. Despite this, you can still begin to establish a bedtime routine at this age (more on this below). Over time, this routine will help to cue their body that it\u2019s time to wind down for the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to start a daily routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they hit about four months, your baby (and let\u2019s face it, you!) is usually ready to start sticking to a schedule a little more reliably. If you haven\u2019t already, you\u2019ll want to get a bedtime routine in place at this point. While it\u2019s possible to implement a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bedtime routine for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toddler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s much easier if you start well in advance so they&#8217;re used to it by the time they become a threenager. We suggest something like: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/bathing-a-newborn\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bath<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, book, feed and bed. You\u2019ll likely be nursing your little one to sleep for the first few months (if not longer). This is fine provided you\u2019re not putting them down in their crib with a bottle (it\u2019s bad for their teeth). Sleep training purists will likely tell you to push the feed earlier in the routine to get rid of any feed-to-sleep associations, but we\u2019re all about what will get everyone the most sleep as smoothly as possible. If you do decide to sleep train, however, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get to the four-month mark, you can also begin to establish a daily routine. This won\u2019t be a \u201chard and fast\u201d schedule though until your baby moves to one nap somewhere between 13-18 months. This is because the timing of your daily routine will fluctuate slightly as you\u2019ll likely be working with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/babys-sleep-schedule\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wake windows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the length of time your baby can stay up between naps). This is totally normal!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bedtime routine for toddlers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the timing will vary, your child\u2019s bedtime routine isn\u2019t going to change that much as they age. Unless that is, you let your toddler decide the order of operations. Toddlers are masters at prolonging bedtime and if you leave it to them, things will get pretty crazy pretty fast. Unless you want the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bedtime routine for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toddler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to include an episode of Peppa Pig, multiple snacks, four trips to the potty, and 17 songs and stories, you\u2019ll have to put your foot down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite their wishes, your toddler\u2019s bedtime routine should be short and sweet, clocking in at about half an hour (this is going to be aspirational at first but you\u2019ll get there eventually). Start with a bath, followed by jammies, reading and bed. Somewhere in there you\u2019ll brush their teeth and toilet them as well, just try to keep things in the same order to solidify the routine. And just like you, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good sleep hygiene<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means no screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Pre-sleep time should be as soothing as possible, so as much as your toddler may want to play indoor basketball or practice their headstands, try and redirect them to a quieter activity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby\u2019s daily routine chart<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaper changes aren\u2019t included in this <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby routine chart<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it\u2019s expected that you\u2019ll change your baby about every two hours (or when their diaper is wet or soiled) except during the overnight period. This schedule is appropriate for a baby between nine to 12 months who is on two naps, but can be adjusted up or down depending on whether your baby is older or younger.

A few months in age can make a huge difference in sleep needs when your child is young, and they may need two naps long after their little friends have shifted to one. As long as your baby\u2019s day is reasonably structured and both of you are getting enough sleep you\u2019re doing great. And as always, if you have any questions, reach out to their pediatrician.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From lessening behavioural issues to easing the
