They can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s not always possible to gauge how ill they are just by looking at them. Fortunately, there are some hard and fast rules about when to call the doctor for a sick baby. Read on to find out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when to take your baby or toddler to the doctor for a cough<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or fever, and when you can safely treat it at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to tell if baby\u2019s sick<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fever is an important indicator of illness, but visual and behavioural cues can sometimes give you more of a sense of how sick your child actually is. If they are, you\u2019ll likely see at least a few of these <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinginess<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fussing or crying more than usual<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping more than usual<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lethargy, low energy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decrease in appetite<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flushed or abnormally pale skin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coughing or wheezing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Runny or snotty nose<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diarrhea, loose stool or vomiting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rash<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be hard to distinguish between the symptoms of cold, flu and COVID-19. Check out our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/cold-flu-allergies-or-covid-19-how-to-tell-the-difference\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">handy primer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for help comparing symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How high is too high for a baby fever?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will get a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at some point in their first year, but in their first three months and especially the first 30 days, having a fever can be quite serious. Normal body temperature is 37 degrees celsius and anything above 38 is considered a fever, so if your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is under three months and has a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temperature<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.pediatrics.ubc.ca\/body-systems\/neonate\/fever-in-the-newborn-period\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 38 degrees celsius<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they need medical attention. At this age, a fever might be symptomatic of a dangerous infection. Fevers in infants between three and six months are generally less concerning, but it\u2019s a good idea to connect with their doctor anyway, to rule out anything serious. Just to complicate matters, however, an infection can sometimes cause an infant\u2019s temperature to drop below 37 degrees. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to look for other symptoms of illness \u2014 temperature doesn\u2019t always tell the whole story.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat fever in babies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as your child is at least six months old, you can give them baby Tylenol or Advil to bring their fever down. You can also cool your child down by removing extra clothing or their sleep sack and by wiping their forehead or the back of their neck with a cool washcloth. But no matter how much your grandma swears by it, NEVER try to bring your child&#8217;s fever down by giving them an ice bath. Not only is it ineffective, it\u2019s also dangerous \u2014 babies can&#8217;t regulate their body temperature that well and an ice bath risks causing hypothermia, which can lead to death.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat fever in infants<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child is younger than six months, you\u2019ll need to consult with their doctor first before giving them baby Advil or Tylenol. Offer your baby their bottle or your breast regularly when they\u2019re sick to make sure they\u2019re taking in lots of fluids. The risk for dehydration increases when children are sick, so keep an eye on the number of wet diapers they\u2019re producing (at least <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\/health-issues\/injuries-emergencies\/Pages\/dehydration.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six a day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for infants). And if you\u2019re at all concerned, speak to a doctor right away \u2014 dehydration in infants is quite serious and potentially life threatening. Never give a baby, child or teenager Aspirin or Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as it can cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/myhealth.alberta.ca\/Health\/Pages\/conditions.aspx?hwid=sta123355&amp;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reye\u2019s syndrome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a serious and sometimes fatal condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby\u2019s first cold<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your baby gets a cold their runny nose can last for a while, making it seem like they&#8217;re sick forever<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how long does a baby cold actually last? I<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n reality, most babies are over the worst of their symptoms after a few days. You might find, however, that your little one needs their nose aspirated and\/or wiped for up to three weeks after they first get sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat your baby\u2019s cold<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep is an important part of treating your baby\u2019s cold at home. Luckily, figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to get a sick baby to sleep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn\u2019t always harder than getting a well baby to sleep. Increased sleep needs often go hand-in-hand with illness, making your little one more likely to nod off during a feed or even in the middle of an activity. It\u2019ll get more difficult, however, if they\u2019re at all uncomfortable. Many parents find that a nasal aspirator and saline solution are essential during their child\u2019s first 18 months as babies can&#8217;t blow their own noses at this age. When it comes to clearing congestion, recommendations are likely different than they were when you were growing up. Products like Vicks vaporub are no longer recommended for children under two, as they may cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19136404\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inflammation and airway obstruction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Likewise, OTC cough medicine is a no-no for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/healthycanadians.gc.ca\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2016\/57622a-eng.php#:~:text=Health%20Canada%20reminds%20parents%20and,medications%20labelled%20only%20for%20adults.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children under six<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead, try running a humidifier in their room. This should help with any congestion they might have. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to see a doctor<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is always a medical emergency if you think your baby may be having trouble breathing. The same goes if their lips or nails take on a bluish tinge, which can indicate low blood oxygen levels. In both cases, dial 9-1-1 immediately. In non-emergency cases, you should still see a doctor, however, if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your child\u2019s fever has lasted longer than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/fever_and_temperature_taking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72 hours<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their fever breaks and then returns<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You suspect your child is dehydrated<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your child seems lethargic\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your child has a fever and is under six months<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re at all concerned about their behaviour or feel like something is \u201coff\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re not going to be completely able to keep your baby from getting sick. But with the right info you can find yourself prepared for when it does happen. Practice good hand hygiene and make sure that their vaccines are up to date. Most baby illnesses run their course within a few days without complications.
