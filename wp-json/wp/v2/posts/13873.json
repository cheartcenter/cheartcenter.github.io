Is eczema just a regular rash? If so, why does it tend to appear on and off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema is a condition that causes dry, itchy skin. The itching can be so bad that you scratch compulsively, even while you\u2019re sleeping. With all that scratching, skin can become thick, red, inflamed, and covered in hives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema is related to your immune system. People with allergies, hay fever, or asthma are more at risk of developing eczema. This is because of the type 2 immune system response. The type 2 immune system response is generally triggered by allergies. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2018\/02\/180227115555.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It shortens the lipid molecules<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your skin, reducing their ability to retain moisture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What causes eczema?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your skin plays a big role in your overall health. Not only is your skin the largest organ in your body, it\u2019s also a protective barrier between your internal organs and the external world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema is linked to a genetic mutation that makes it hard for your skin to retain proper moisture. When your skin\u2019s moisture levels go down, that weakens your skin\u2019s protection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a combination of factors that causes eczema. There\u2019s your genetics, your innate immune system, and external factors like harsh soaps or emotional stress. Then, there\u2019s the fact that eczema itches like crazy. Some people get into a loop where they scratch their eczema so hard that they damage their skin\u2019s moisture barrier even more, leading to new eczema flare-ups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who gets eczema?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get eczema, there\u2019s a strong likelihood that your parents passed it down to you. Mutation of the filaggrin gene is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/500402\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked to 75% of eczema cases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who have eczema also tend to have allergies. Half of patients with moderate to severe eczema also suffer from asthma, hay fever, and food allergies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema tends to show up when patients are children. Even infants can get eczema. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanfordchildrens.org\/en\/topic\/default?id=atopic-dermatitis-in-children-90-P01675\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies and kids tend to get eczema<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because their immune system hasn\u2019t finished developing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema symptoms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema has such telltale signs that doctors often diagnose the condition just by looking at it.

The following tips can help soothe your skin and relieve some itching. They\u2019re not a substitute for seeing a dermatologist or allergist. A doctor can prescribe medication that interacts with your immune system, bringing more profound and long-term symptom relief.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify what triggers your eczema. Common triggers include dry heat, low humidity, harsh soaps, wool fabrics, and allergens.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisturize twice daily with a gentle, unscented moisturizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use gentle soaps for hand washing and bathing. Look for unscented soaps as fragrance can cause irritation.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limit your baths and showers to under 15 minutes. Bathing too long can overdry your skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dry skin gently after bathing. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still wet.<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a bleach bath. This sounds extreme, but it\u2019s actually recommended by dermatology associations to reduce skin infections and calm flare-ups. Add \u00bd a cup of bleach to a 151 litre bathtub. Soak for no more than ten minutes, and don\u2019t dip your head underwater. Bleach baths should be taken no more than twice a week.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take an allergy medication to calm your allergic immune response.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear smooth fabrics like silk or cotton. Avoid coarse fabrics like wool that can irritate and itch.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice relaxation and mindfulness techniques. This can help keep flare-ups at bay, and help you deal with the itching and mental distress of a current flare-up.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a baking soda or oatmeal bath. For baking soda baths, add \u00bc cup of oatmeal to a full bathtub. For oatmeal baths, add a \u00bd cup of rolled or ground oatmeal to a full bath. Oatmeal and baking soda baths are very soothing for skin redness and can help calm itchiness.\u00a0<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take vitamin D supplements. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaaai.org\/conditions-and-treatments\/library\/allergy-library\/eczema-atopic-dermatitis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some research shows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a link between eczema and vitamin D deficiency.<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical treatment for eczema<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema is frustrating when it comes back again and again. A doctor can provide stronger, longer-term solutions than using gentle soaps or taking oatmeal baths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question is, should you see an allergist, dermatologist, or general practitioner to treat persistent eczema? The answer depends on how complicated your condition is. If your eczema is linked to an auto-immune condition, is severe, or is worsening over time, an allergist is the better choice. You\u2019ll need extensive testing to pinpoint the underlying causes. If your eczema is moderate and doesn\u2019t interfere too much with life, a dermatologist or GP will offer quicker solutions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how doctors offer clinical eczema treatment:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicated creams such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oral or topical antibiotics to fight infection.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oral anti-inflammatory medication.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injectable biologic (monoclonal antibody) called dupilumab (Dupixent). This is used to treat people with severe cases of eczema who don\u2019t see improvement with other treatment options.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UV light therapy.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema is an uncomfortable condition with all the skin tenderness and itching it causes. There\u2019s also a big psychological component. Since our skin is so visible to everyone around us, skin conditions can make us want to cover up and avoid social situations. It\u2019s frustrating to not live life on your own terms. Luckily, eczema is treatable with the right help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An allergist or dermatologist provides treatments that really make a difference. Since eczema can be a lifelong condition, it\u2019s better to get help sooner so you can enjoy more years of short sleeves, long baths, and peaceful sleep.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eczema is a common skin condition that causes redness, irritation, and lots of itching.
