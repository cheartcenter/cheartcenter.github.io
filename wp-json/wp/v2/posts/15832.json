You try to ignore it, send an email, and wince at the tightness in your hips. By the time the work day\u2019s over, you\u2019re managing a full blown tension headache.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your work day has become increasingly miserable due to chronic muscle soreness, a simple but important issue may be to blame \u2014 poor posture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What exactly is good posture, and why is it important for your health?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posture is how you hold yourself in daily life. This includes when you\u2019re standing up, sitting at your computer, or unloading the dishwasher.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s worth paying attention to your posture. Poor posture can cause muscle soreness, wear and tear in your joints, decreased range of motion, and wobbly balance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s good posture? Good posture means properly aligned vertebrae or as <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Health<\/span><\/i> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/pain\/posture-and-back-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">describes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201ckeeping the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar curves in balance and aligned, with weight distributed evenly over the feet.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In plain English, this means keeping your head aligned with your neck and your shoulder in line with your hips.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a quick posture test<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before diving into exercises, it helps to know what good posture feels like. Take this quick <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/adult-health\/in-depth\/posture-align-yourself-for-good-health\/art-20269950\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posture test<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to start off:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand with your back to the wall.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let your shoulder blades and buttocks touch the wall. Place your feet about two inches away from the wall.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slip your hand into the space between the wall and the small of your back.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your hand barely fits, you\u2019ve got good posture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your hand has ample room, bring your belly button in towards your spine to straighten out your back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walk away from the wall while maintaining this position. This is your goal for good posture. You can check your posture throughout the day by using the wall as a test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re into yoga, think of mountain pose or tadasana. This is a simple but foundational pose that focuses on \u201cstanding with integrity\u201d and strengthening your mind-body awareness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if you can\u2019t maintain perfect posture without discomfort? What if every time you straighten up, your body shifts back into a slumping position without you even realizing it?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No need to panic. Our body has a way of getting used to poor posture. So when you suddenly start standing correctly, it\u2019s unfamiliar. Your body whines and begs you to fall back into old habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is you can absolutely train your body to stand up straight without pain. It just takes a little practice. Fortunately, you can strengthen your muscles with a few daily exercises.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number one \u2014 chin tucks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with an easy one. Take a seat with your head upright and flatten your feet on the floor. Now gently move your chin down towards your neck and keep that position for five seconds. Come back to your original position and do it again ten times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chin tucks are helpful for addressing what\u2019s known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.physio-pedia.com\/Forward_Head_Posture\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forward head posture<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The head juts out and the neck elongates, leading to symptoms like headaches and neck and shoulder pain. Taking a few minutes each day to perform chin tucks will remind you to realign your head to the rest of your body.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you spend all day staring at a screen, you may develop forward head posture due to constantly leaning in to squint at a document or spreadsheet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number two \u2014 shoulder blade squeezes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with the same position as the chin tuck, but this time put your hands on your lap. Move your shoulders back until your shoulder blades are pushed together. Hold that for five seconds and repeat three times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good trick is to imagine you\u2019re holding a pencil between your shoulder blades each time you squeeze.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shoulder blade squeeze helps reduce rounded shoulders. Rounded shoulders happen when the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/318556#Causes-and-risk-factors-for-rounded-shoulders\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoulders aren\u2019t aligned with the spine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, leading to back ache. It\u2019s a common problem, particularly if you\u2019re an office worker who sits at a computer all day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number three \u2014 cow-face squeezes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lift your right arm straight up and then bend at the elbow, placing your fingers on your back. Grab the fingers of your right hand with your left hand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this step is tricky, use a yoga scarf or strap in between both hands. Next, move your elbows back and breathe in. Keep this position for about five seconds before switching sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t grab your other hand. As you perform this exercise daily, you\u2019ll reduce the gap between your left and right hand. A stretch should never hurt, so be gentle and mindful while moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This arm and shoulder movement is similar to cow-face pose, or gomukhasana, in yoga. The only difference is that in yoga you\u2019d perform this pose while kneeling. A cow-face squeeze can be done while standing or while sitting at your desk.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number four \u2014 hero pose<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kneel with your thighs pressed together and your feet behind you. The tops of your feet should be on the floor with the soles facing up. Straighten your back and hold this position for about a minute. Try this every morning and see how much longer you can hold the pose each day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hero pose, also known as virasana, helps you practice how to properly align your spine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good posture comes down to both physical and mental training. It\u2019s important to physically realign, but it\u2019s also important to mentally be aware of how you\u2019re holding your body and self-correct throughout the day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number five \u2014 arm-across-chest stretch<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand up straight and bring your right arm to the same height as your shoulder. Arch your arm at the elbow and use your other hand to pull your elbow across your chest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do this three times on each side for about 20 seconds. This stretch helps relieve tension in your shoulders and prevent rounding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a great one to do at your desk while on a long call or staring at an endless spreadsheet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move number six \u2014 cat-cow stretch<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find something soft, get down on all fours, and straighten your back. To move into cow pose, curl your toes under so that the soles of your feet are perpendicular to the ground. Push your pelvis upwards so that your tailbone is pointing out, your belly moves down, and your neck moves up. You should wind up looking at the ceiling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To transition into cat pose, rest the tops of your feet on the ground, tuck your tailbone back in by moving your pelvis forward. Your spine will become round and your head will face downwards. Then, switch back and forth from cat pose to cow pose using deep breathing to support your movements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movement helps stretch your back and neck and develop awareness of how your body feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Try out some yoga<\/h2>\n<p>Yoga is a great way to gently mobilize your body.
