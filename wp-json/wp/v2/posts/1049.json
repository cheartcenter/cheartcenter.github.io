He\u2019s experiencing the stress of erectile issues and struggling with the stigma that accompanies discussing sexual health. \u201cSexual issues aren\u2019t something that were ever really talked about when I was growing up, and frankly, even if I got the nerve to talk to my doctor about it, I can\u2019t afford to take a whole afternoon off for a non-urgent appointment.\u201d It\u2019s a problem that puts Anthony at risk for depression and a variety of other issues. Like a lot of men in his position, at first Anthony turned to drugs like Viagra and Cialis to help with his ED. But there was a problem. \u201cThe drugs were making it possible for me to have sex, but not for me to really enjoy it the way I used to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is a serious issue: Not getting treatment is <i>never<\/i> the answer when something is affecting your day-to-day life.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s very difficult for men like Anthony to broach this subject when dealing with the stigma surrounding men and their sexual health, particularly at the place where sexual and mental health meet. \u00a0\u201cThis shame and secrecy around an experience that\u00a0is near-universal only serves to intensify the problem,\u201d says<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sexwithdrjess.com\/podcast-2\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jessica O\u2019Reilly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a noted sexologist and relationship expert.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re not alone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony is not alone. In fact, he\u2019s part of the vast majority of Canadian men who are dealing with this issue. \u201cThe reality is that all men will lose an erection at an inopportune time at some point\u00a0in their lives and it doesn\u2019t have to be the elephant in the room,\u201d continued O\u2019Reilly. Canadians have been taught to be embarrassed about personal issues\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like ED\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and it doesn\u2019t get any easier when you have to sit for hours in a waiting room before an overscheduled doctor has time to see you. Men like Anthony need different strategies, and there are a lot of available\u00a0options for an issue like ED.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing to understand about a loss of erection is that that\u00a0it\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not your<\/span><\/i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fault<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are a variety of physical and psychological conditions that make it a lot more likely to occur, including the effects of many medications and the aging process. It\u2019s normal, and even in the moment it doesn\u2019t have to ruin the sex you\u2019re having. Adjustments to pace or position can maintain the enjoyment for you and your partner, and above all \u2014\u00a0\u00a0relaxation is key. Stress is a big factor in loss of erection and if you\u2019re enjoying yourself there\u2019s a chance of it coming back on its own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle factors are also important when dealing with sexual response, and practical changes to the way you exercise and eat can have a positive impact on your sex life\u00a0in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A balanced diet and regular exercise also help with another important factor: stress. Stress plays hell with sexual response at the best of times, and if you have a tendency towards loss of erection intrusive thoughts can ruin even the most enjoyable sexual encounter. Relaxation exercises, meditation, or yoga can be incredibly\u00a0helpful in this respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing, though, of course, is to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talk about what\u2019s happening<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Your partner should be aware of what\u2019s happening, because it\u2019s not your fault and it\u2019s not their fault either. Take advantage of the opportunity this presents to explore other options for the two of you that\u00a0you may have been missing out on by previously adhering to conventional sexual positions or acts. Many men end up considering their difficulties maintaining an erection to be blessings because of the new things that try because of it. As O\u2019Reilly puts it: \u201cTalking to your partner can certainly\u00a0help, and though you certainly\u00a0don\u2019t need an erection to have sex, research indicates that erectile issues may be an indication of a medical condition, so it\u2019s essential to check in with a doctor too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making difficult conversations easier<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you need to talk to a doctor, it\u2019s important for the appointment to be a positive experience for you. Regardless of all the ways that you may improve your outlook or perspective concerning ED, it\u2019s still a sensitive and uncomfortable conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re dealing with ED, a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI), or anything that affects your sexual health, we know that you want a comfortable and quiet place to talk about it. That\u2019s why an online doctor\u2019s appointment can be invaluable; it takes place wherever and whenever you want it to. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\">Chat with a qualified, attentive doctor<\/a> for as long as you need to get answers for all of your questions.
