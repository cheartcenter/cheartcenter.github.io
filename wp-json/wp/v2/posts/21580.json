That thick, moist air doesn\u2019t just weigh you down, it also flattens your curls. If you have straight hair, the humidity is all but guaranteed to frizz it out. But the change in season won\u2019t just ruin your hairstyle, it can also affect the overall health of your hair. Here\u2019s how to counteract some of the stress the change of season has on your hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hair health and the sun<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting out from under your winter toque into that warm sunshine is a glorious feeling, but those sun-kissed highlights come with a cost. Just like your skin, your hair is also vulnerable to the sun\u2019s rays. Summer sunshine gives you those natural highlights because your hair is being bleached by UV rays. While your hair colour might be killer, the trade off is drier, more brittle hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the pandemic is keeping you from your regular salon visits, your hair\u2019s dryness may be even more noticeable this summer. To counteract this, bring along a hat with UV protective fabric if you know you\u2019ll be out in the sun for a while. If you have fine or thin hair, this will do double duty and protect your scalp from sunburn as well. You can also use a weekly deep-conditioning treatment to add some additional moisture to your hair, and if you\u2019re a daily hair washer, try\u00a0 alternating days to leave some of your hair\u2019s natural oils intact.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Chlorine is not your friend<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few things are more relaxing than lounging by the pool in the summer. Chlorine, however, is enemy number one when it comes to your hair. Chlorine strips the natural oils from your hair and your skin, leaving both in desperate need of moisture. It can also cause chemical reactions in colour-treated hair and natural hair colour. So if you\u2019re going to take a dip, go prepared. If you regularly swim laps, a bathing cap is a must to keep your hair healthy. For simply lounging in the water, ditch the rubber cap and hang out with your head above water. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can apply a deep conditioning treatment before you take the plunge. Alternatively, you can rinse your hair with cold water before going under. Your hair can only absorb so much water, so it\u2019s better that it takes in the freshwater rather than the chlorine-infused pool water.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Style for the season<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever used a clothes iron to straighten your hair, you know that it leaves your locks pin straight and thoroughly fried. The heat from a summer\u2019s day isn&#8217;t as drastic, but in combination with hot styling tools, it quickly adds up. If you colour treat your hair, it\u2019s likely to be even more susceptible to damage from heat and the sun. The good news is that summer calls for a more carefree approach to styling. If you can, opt for natural styles over ones that require a curling or straightening iron. And if you have to use a hot styling tool, make sure to protect the health of your hair with a leave-in conditioning treatment first.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your hormones and your hair<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testosterone is usually thought of as a male hormone. It\u2019s actually present in both sexes, however,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and your levels of it are usually higher in the spring and fall. Since <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-540-46911-7_2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fluctuations in hormonal levels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can cause you to shed more hair than usual, many of us see additional hair loss during seasonal shifts. Melatonin is another hormone that regulates <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medigraphic.com\/cgi-bin\/new\/resumenI.cgi?IDARTICULO=56418\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how the body grows hair<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and your body makes less of it with the increased sunshine of the summer months. This likely contributes to having more resting follicles during summer, which are essentially hairs that are just waiting to fall out \u2014 so if you notice more hair loss during the dog days of summer, you\u2019re probably right.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diet and hair health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you take into your body manifests externally. For some, the change in season comes with a significant change in eating and drinking habits. If your summer diet means drinking more alcohol than usual, or upping your junk food intake, you might see the effects in your hair. Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals may cause hair loss. Less extreme cases, however, can cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hairscientists.org\/hair-and-scalp-conditions\/nutrition-and-hair-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dry, stringy, and dull hair<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Limit these effects by eating a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/food-guide.canada.ca\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balanced diet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Aim for five to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and make sure you\u2019re taking in enough protein and fat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no doubt that the change in season can affect your hair. But if you find that your hair is going through a major transformation, it might be more than just a transition of the equinox. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/hypothyroidism-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thyroid disorders<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, stress, some medications, and illness can all trigger hair changes. If you notice that your hair brush is fuller than usual, or you have to buy a robot vacuum to deal with all the shedding, it\u2019s worth taking stock to see if you have any other symptoms. Your hair loss might be attributable to something other than the change of season.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Canadians look forward to the lazy, hazy days of summer all year, but the warm, humid weather isn\u2019t always so hot for your hair.
