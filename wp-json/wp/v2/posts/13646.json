The average employee takes approximately 8.5 sick days per year, costing their employer around $2,000. Employees with chronic pain also find it difficult to be productive while at work. Their symptoms, such as constant discomfort, fatigue, brain fog, and motor issues can get in the way of full performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Jamie\u2019s chronic health struggles<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie\u2019s had asthma since she was a young child. At the age of six, she found she couldn\u2019t catch her breath during an after-school soccer game. Her parents took her to their family doctor, who diagnosed asthma and provided Jamie with an inhaler for future flare-ups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Jamie\u2019s in the workforce, she has to balance giving her body rest and care with meeting work deadlines. That\u2019s easier said than done for a young articling attorney. After a huge push of work for a high-profile client, Jamie became mentally and physically exhausted. She developed a cough, which turned into sleepless nights of wheezing, and fatigued mornings that further compromised her immune system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vicious cycle led to Jamie developing severe eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. The eczema spread across her shoulders and down her arms. Despite the hot summer weather, Jamie took to wearing long sleeves to avoid revealing her skin condition to her colleagues. The eczema itched and irritated Jamie, further exacerbating her mental fatigue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie conceded to take four days off from work to have cool showers, apply calamine lotion, and otherwise wait for her dermatitis to go away. During this time, she became withdrawn from communicating with her friends and co-workers. The mental stress of dealing with asthma, insomnia, and now a visible rash was taking its toll.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Jamie found relief<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie knew she had to seek medical attention, but wasn\u2019t sure where to begin. Should she see a general practitioner for advice, a respirologist for her asthma, or a dermatologist to treat her skin condition?<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a difficult choice, as in the best case scenario a general practitioner visit would require an uncomfortable hour in a clinic waiting room. For specialists like respirologists and dermatologists, Jamie knew it would be around a three month wait to obtain an appointment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While looking through her employment benefits package to see about booking an acupuncture appointment, Jamie noticed she could see a doctor online within minutes. \u201cHmm, seems too good to be true,\u201d thought Jamie. \u201cBut what do I have to lose?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Jamie\u2019s surprise, she received nearly immediate assistance through virtual care. After quickly signing up for a Maple account, she requested to see a general practitioner. Within two minutes, she was matched with a family doctor. The visit began over video chat, where Jamie displayed the full extent of her rash and told her doctor about the asthma flare-up that preceded it. The doctor prescribed both a rash and an airway medication, which Jamie selected to pick up from a nearby pharmacy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within hours, Jamie had her medication in hand. The next day, with the help of her prescriptions, Jamie\u2019s breathing felt easy and her eczema no longer itched so strongly. Jamie returned to her office the following Monday with her rash beginning to clear, fully mentally present to take on the next big project.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Action items for employers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many members of your staff struggle silently with chronic pain. To support their abilities to work productively, and boost the wellness culture of your workplace, consider these steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Recognize the disparity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most employers believe there are fairly few employees who deal with chronic pain. The numbers tell a different story. Employers need to be aware of the tendency to underestimate chronic pain within their workforce.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To rectify this, anonymously survey your employees to see if they\u2019re comfortable disclosing their conditions. Let them know that they will in no way be penalized for sharing their information \u2014 the findings will only be used to better support them. Also make it clear that they can opt out from sharing this personal medical information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look to public health data around chronic pain, such as the national websites for common chronic conditions. Use the reported data, and not an estimate of your office, to improve health programs and initiatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/arthritis.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Arthritis Society<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Mental Health Association<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hypertension.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypertension Canada<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.heartandstroke.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lung.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Lung Association<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/asthma.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asthma Canada<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.diabetes.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diabetes Canada<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.

There are few tools that offer the same level of personalized, effective support. Employees can speak to a general practitioner to renew a prescription and find relief from symptoms. They can also speak to specialists such as endocrinologists, respirologists, dermatologists, and a variety of mental health practitioners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

This age range is also reported to experience more workplace mental stress. The upside is, younger employees are more open to using health technology. By cultivating a positive office culture, and providing technology tools, employers can power their younger cohort of employees to work and feel their best.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information on virtual care to manage chronic pain, mental health, and to improve workplace wellness, contact <\/span><a href=\"mailto:sales@getmaple.ca\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sales@getmaple.ca<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The fact that 70% of surveyed Canadians report suffering from chronic pain goes to show how silent but pervasive this condition is.
