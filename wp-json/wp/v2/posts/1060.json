But when she woke up for work the next day, she felt terrible and she knew she needed a prescription. That meant going to the doctor&#8230;which was always a half-day ordeal to get 10 minutes with her doctor.

Alas, she arrived to a crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>7:30 am<\/strong>: Martha squeezed between two of the less contagious-looking people in the room, and they vacillated between trying not to sneeze on her and trying not to sneeze on the people next to them on the other side. It doesn\u2019t seem to end well for anybody, but nobody could think of anything else to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>10:30 am<\/strong>: Martha checked on how long she might have to wait, and a harried-looking man at the desk told her he didn\u2019t know because it was a busy day. It was always a busy day. Martha eyed her spot, watching as someone else settled in between the sneezing gentlemen. She sighed and wondered whether it would be worth it to try to\u00a0get some coffee or if she\u2019d miss her time. She risked it. She missed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Option 2<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6:30am:<\/strong> Martha woke up, looked at the clock, and rolled over to get some\u00a0more sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>7:30 am:<\/strong> Martha woke up again, deciding this time to give getting out of bed a try. She wandered into the kitchen and made herself a cup of coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>8:30 am:<\/strong> Martha settled herself on the couch and pulled out her phone, opened up Maple, and requested an appointment. She sipped her tea and wrapped the blanket a little tighter against herself while she waited, but only for a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pick up a prescription, not the flu!\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ia_hYoOkuyA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Martha wasn\u2019t feeling well on Tuesday night, so she took some over-the-counter flu medicine and went to bed early.
