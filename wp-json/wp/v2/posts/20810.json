In some parts of the country, it can take weeks or even months to see a mental health professional. When you\u2019re in crisis, you need help immediately. There\u2019s no time to browse through doctors who are taking new patients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in crisis, making the decision to seek help at your local hospital\u2019s emergency room can be life-saving. But, the emergency department isn\u2019t always the best place to get help for mental health issues. Here\u2019s how to know when a mental illness is serious enough to make that trip to the ER.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are you having thoughts of suicide, self-harm, or harming others?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you or someone else is having thoughts of suicide or harming others, this is always an emergency. Go to the ER if you can safely do so. But if someone is threatening suicide or homicide, and they\u2019re refusing to go to the hospital, this is a job for 9-1-1. In most jurisdictions, 9-1-1 operators can connect you to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crisisservicescanada.ca\/en\/looking-for-local-resources-support\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crisis response hotline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These crisis lines are staffed by trained volunteers who can help to calm the individual in crisis while you wait for first responders.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Are you presenting with symptoms of psychosis?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While hallucinations and psychosis might seem like a good reason to head to the ER, this isn\u2019t always the case. If you\u2019re already connected to a psychiatrist, and your basic needs are being met, you might not be admitted as an in-patient. Yes, experiencing delusions is scary. But if you can connect with your usual doctor, that\u2019s likely a better solution than the ER.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That all changes, however, if you can\u2019t reach your psychiatrist, or if it\u2019s your first time experiencing these symptoms. Episodes of psychosis may be the result of an underlying mental health issue, but they can also be caused by other things. Certain drugs and medications cause hallucinations or delusions that may look like psychosis, as can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/16571526\/#:~:text=Traumatic%20brain%20injury%20can%20be,relationship%20may%20also%20be%20coincidental.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">head injuries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If someone is experiencing psychosis and they have no previous history of it, they need medical treatment immediately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides mental illness and drug use, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.postpartum.net\/learn-more\/postpartum-psychosis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum psychosis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can also cause symptoms of mental illness. Postpartum psychosis is different from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-overlooked-aspects-of-postpartum-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your partner has given birth within the past year and exhibits any of the following, they need medical care:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delusions or strange beliefs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hallucinations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paranoia and unwarranted suspiciousness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoughts of harming themselves or the baby<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New mothers suffering from postpartum psychosis should not be left alone with their baby until they receive the additional support they need.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Alternatives to the ER<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is that mental health crisis services can be difficult to access. Unless you\u2019re considered a danger to yourself or someone else, you may not require hospital admission for treatment as an in-patient. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/crisis-resources\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile mental health units<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are available in certain parts of the country \u2014 mainly in the larger cities \u2014 but these don\u2019t always guarantee quick access to help. The country does have a number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crisisservicescanada.ca\/en\/looking-for-local-resources-support\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crisis hotlines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, where trained volunteers can walk you through available resources in your area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The best intervention is prevention<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By far the best way of avoiding a mental health crisis is to be proactive. If you notice signs that your loved one is slipping into mental illness, support them to get help before they reach the danger zone. Check in with them regularly, build a relationship of trust, and try and reserve judgment as much as possible. If they know they can turn to you for help, they\u2019re more likely to do so before it becomes an emergency. You should also encourage them to speak to a therapist, psychiatrist, or their family doctor. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our mental health professionals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are available to speak to you seven days a week from the comfort of your own home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental illness can be scary and destabilizing whether you\u2019re the one experiencing it, or you\u2019re supporting a loved one. If you\u2019re unsure if you meet the threshold for going to the ER or not, it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution. Taking care of your health is always worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret that support for mental illness isn&#8217;t as timely as it should be.
