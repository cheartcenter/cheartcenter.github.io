About<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11357905\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of lactating women get mastitis, and to make matters worse, it\u2019s most likely to happen in the first<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw98039\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of breastfeeding \u2014 when you\u2019re just starting to get the hang of being a mom and you\u2019re completely sleep deprived. Luckily, with proper support, mastitis is easily curable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is mastitis?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastitis is a painful inflammation of the breast tissue, which is sometimes accompanied by an infection. Since it occurs most often in breastfeeding women, it can be difficult to distinguish mastitis from a blocked duct. But while a blocked duct can lead to mastitis, the two are quite\u00a0different \u2014 more on this below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What causes mastitis?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastitis is typically caused by a blocked duct or by bacteria getting into the breast (which is often precipitated by a cracked nipple). Blocked ducts occur for a number of reasons, including an irregular breastfeeding schedule or a wonky latch. This is why it happens so often in the immediate postpartum period when newborns\u2019 sleep can be unpredictable and before you\u2019ve gotten the hang of breastfeeding. And because your nipples are often raw during this stage, they can crack and allow bacteria in. Curiously, the biggest risk factor for mastitis is having had it before. So although every baby is different, if you had mastitis with one, you\u2019re more likely to have it again. Mastitis can be extremely\u00a0painful and causes many women to quit nursing altogether. This, however, can make the condition worse, as breastfeeding actually\u00a0helps to clear it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the early signs of mastitis?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nursing isn\u2019t always comfortable, and run-of-the-mill clogs happen, so mastitis can be easy to miss at first. Pain in one of your breasts, a small lump, redness, or discomfort during nursing are early signs. But these can also be typical when your milk is coming in and you\u2019re just adjusting to nursing. Feeling tired or a bit\u00a0under the weather are other early signs, but given that you&#8217;re dealing with a newborn these are easy to overlook too. Unless you\u2019ve had it before (and even then), it&#8217;s possible that you won\u2019t realize you have mastitis until the symptoms become more acute.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of mastitis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if horrible breast pain weren\u2019t enough, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are a number of o<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ther <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headache<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itchiness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A warm, red patch on the breast<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hard lump in the breast<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Breast tenderness<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain during nursing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chills<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headache<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aches and pains all over the body<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>I have symptoms of mastitis but I\u2019m not breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although much more unlikely, it\u2019s still possible to get mastitis even if you aren\u2019t breastfeeding. Periductal mastitis, as it\u2019s called, happens when the ducts under the nipple become infected and inflamed. The cause is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5949503\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unknown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The condition usually presents with a mass or hard lump in the breast, as well as discharge (bloody or otherwise); sometimes the nipple retracts (turns inward). This typically occurs in women;\u00a0 smokers, those with diabetes, and people who are obese are at<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/mi\/2017\/5309081\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In rare cases, men can also get mastitis. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">periductal mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sometimes involves surgery to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remove the affect<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ed duct, but is typically treated by draining the duct or with antibiotics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Preventing mastitis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastitis prevention<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be tricky. In one study, women using nipple cream (and weirdly, papaya-based ones in particular) were<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1111\/j.1753-6405.2001.tb01831.x#targetText=Women%20who%20used%20papaya%20cream,baseline%20variables%20in%201%2C075%20women.\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to develop mastitis than those who used either a nipple cream without papaya or no nipple cream at all. Given how rough breastfeeding can be on your nipples, however, no one is suggesting that you give up nipple cream. One possible\u00a0reason to fault the nipple cream, though, is when bacteria gets into the cream from your fingers. Make sure you\u2019re practicing proper sanitation and hand washing. If you use reusable breast pads, replace them when wet, and wash them according to manufacturer guidelines to kill any bacteria. In the event that you develop thrush or mastitis, you should\u00a0switch to disposable pads until the condition has cleared.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing tight and restrictive clothing on your chest can increase the risk of developing mastitis. Because breast size can increase dramatically while lactating, it&#8217;s a good idea to invest in some new bras (and try to avoid underwire). Other issues such as an improper latch can also increase your likelihood of the condition, so you might want to\u00a0speak with a lactation consultant if you and baby are having trouble. When you\u2019re weaning, cut down on feeds gradually instead of reducing them suddenly. And finally,\u00a0always try to avoid engorgement by draining the breast at each feed. You can pump or hand express if your baby doesn\u2019t drain you completely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Natural mastitis treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its earliest stages, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is often sufficient. At the first sign of a clog, you can use hot compresses on your breast before each nursing session, hand express in a hot shower, or submerge the affected breast in a hot bath and gently <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">massage<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-affected area. And although it can be painful, it\u2019s important that you continue breastfeeding or pumping. Your milk may taste saltier, which may put your child off of nursing on that side but keep trying. If you can\u2019t get baby to drink, you\u2019ll want to pump to ensure the breast is completely drained. By continuing to pump or nurse, you\u2019re both working to clear the infection and maintain your supply. And don\u2019t worry, drinking milk from the affected breast won\u2019t harm your child\u00a0in any way. You may also want to connect with a lactation consultant (LC), as they can help you find a less painful position to nurse in and teach you how to improve your baby\u2019s latch going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If none of that works, there are two other options: getting an ultrasound treatment on the mastitis-affected breast at a physiotherapy clinic (sound waves help break up the clogs) or enlisting your partner to try sucking it out (this is called the \u201cbig baby method\u201d). But it\u2019s important to act fast: mastitis symptoms can get worse extremely quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to see a doctor<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If symptoms progress and you experience fever and\/or flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s important to see a doctor right away. In this case, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will involve <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antibiotics<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Once you begin your round of oral <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antibiotics<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> symptoms should begin to\u00a0clear within 24 hours. As with all antibiotics, however, it\u2019s important that you<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/antibiotic-resistance\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complete the course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prescribed even if you feel better right away. And, of course, continue nursing as it\u2019s perfectly safe, even with the antibiotics (although you can confirm with your doctor, as some antibiotics may not be safe with breastfeeding).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Complications<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If mastitis progresses untreated, abscesses can develop. Abscesses require immediate treatment, which can involve aspiration or surgical drainage. In rare cases, untreated <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may cause <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sepsis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/sepsis\/what-is-sepsis.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sepsis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the body&#8217;s extreme reaction to infection, and it can result in organ failure and even death. Signs can include: chills, fever, rapid and shallow breathing and confusion. If you think you may have sepsis, seek medical attention immediately \u2014 it&#8217;s a medical emergency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many women aren\u2019t aware that breastfeeding comes with many potential challenges.
