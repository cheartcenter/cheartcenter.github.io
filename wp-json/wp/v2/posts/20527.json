But, chances are you\u2019ve also heard that the occasional glass of wine during pregnancy won\u2019t hurt. You may even know women who\u2019ve done it, and gone on to have perfectly healthy children. Though it may seem unlikely that a small amount of alcohol could cause damage, the truth about drinking during pregnancy is more complex, and darker.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/Article?contentid=341&amp;language=English\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teratogen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which means it crosses the placenta, causing harm to a developing fetus. As a teratogen, alcohol is in the same category as radiation, certain viruses, chemicals, and drugs, among other things. Teratogens affect a developing fetus in differing ways \u2014 it all depends on the point in fetal development when the exposure takes place, the specific teratogen, and the amount or pattern of exposure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of alcohol, drinking during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormalities in the baby, ranging from intellectual disability to miscarriage. One of the most serious and long-term effects is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). While there is a range in terms of impairment, children with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/mental-illness-and-addiction-index\/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FASD<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are more likely to have sensory sensitivities, issues with impulse control, learning disabilities, mental illness such as depression, specific facial deformities, and an inability to understand the consequences of their actions. FASD is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/substance-use\/problematic-alcohol-use.html#a7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number one cause<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of preventable developmental disability in Canada. While FASD can be treated, it has no cure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How much alcohol is too much during pregnancy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a myth out there that FASD only happens to women who binge drink. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t true. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/alcohol-how-much-is-too-much\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binge drinking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for women means having four or more alcoholic beverages in one interval. According to Sick Kids Hospital, women with the highest risk of having a baby with FASD have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/Article?contentid=857&amp;language=English\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two or more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> alcoholic beverages a day. Even if you\u2019re drinking significantly less than two drinks a day, however, you\u2019re not in the green zone. The same goes for consuming light beer, or diluted drinks like a wine spritzer \u2014 they\u2019re not \u201csafer\u201d than a glass of wine, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of regular exposure to alcohol are cumulative, and drinking regularly throughout your pregnancy is dangerous, even in small amounts. We don\u2019t yet know why certain babies are born with FASD and others aren\u2019t, or what level of drinking will result in a baby with FASD. Your baby\u2019s brain develops throughout your pregnancy and any amount of alcohol can have effects. This means that alcohol exposure at any time during the pregnancy can put the baby at risk \u2014 even before the woman knows she\u2019s pregnant. The safest course of action is to steer clear of it completely while you\u2019re pregnant or trying to get pregnant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do the positive effects of a daily glass of red wine cancel out the negative effects?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what about maternal health? Isn\u2019t a daily glass of red wine supposed to be good for your health? Actually, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/blog\/is-red-wine-good-actually-for-your-heart-2018021913285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doesn\u2019t bear that out. We don\u2019t have data from long-term, randomized trials measuring the effects of a daily glass of wine. The existing studies we have on the subject are observational \u2014 meaning any health benefits of drinking might be purely coincidental. If you\u2019re feeling anxious and are used to unwinding with a glass of wine at the end of the day, speak to your doctor about other alternatives. There\u2019s no safe level of alcohol intake during pregnancy, no matter how much you might feel it de-stresses you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>I\u2019ve stopped drinking during my pregnancy. Can I start again while nursing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While drinking and breastfeeding is less dangerous than drinking during pregnancy, it\u2019s still not recommended, especially during the newborn phase. Alcohol passes into breast milk, and your little one is much less able to process alcohol than you are. While you might have heard that it\u2019s ok, there\u2019s a lot of conflicting and downright bad information out there about drinking and breastfeeding \u2014 spoiler, pumping and dumping doesn\u2019t help, and alcohol <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> increase your milk production. For more in-depth info on the topic, check out our blog on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/boozy-breastfeeding-is-it-safe-to-drink-and-nurse\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drinking and nursing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While forgoing your evening glass of wine might be a bummer, nine months goes by surprisingly quickly when you\u2019re looking forward to having a new baby. Better to err on the side of caution than to risk the potential consequences of drinking during pregnancy. The fact is, consuming <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of alcohol during your pregnancy is potentially dangerous. It\u2019s just not worth risking the health of your baby.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know you\u2019re not supposed to drink alcohol while pregnant.
