But when it comes to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alcohol and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/lactation-specialist\/\">breastfeeding<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, what are the rules? Maybe you\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s ok as long as you pump and dump? Or that as long as you stick to beer it\u2019s actually beneficial to the breastfeeding process? There\u2019s a ton of conflicting and downright bad advice out there. So sit tight, and let us break down the facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can I drink alcohol if I\u2019m breastfeeding?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that while breastfeeding parents shouldn\u2019t drink, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/vaccinations-medications-drugs\/alcohol.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one drink a day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn\u2019t known to be harmful. The Australian Breastfeeding Association, in contrast, says that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.breastfeeding.asn.au\/sites\/default\/files\/imce\/ABA_Alchohol_BF%20for%20website.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three or more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> drinks is harmful. So if major organizations can\u2019t give a clear answer, what\u2019s the average mom supposed to do? The short answer is to err on the side of caution, because the effects of alcohol are hard to measure. So yes, you can have an alcoholic drink if you are breastfeeding, but under specific circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Measuring alcohol intake<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you\u2019re sober enough to drive, you\u2019re sober enough to breastfeed,\u201d might sound like good advice but objectively measuring your own sobriety can be difficult. Numerous factors affect your body\u2019s ability to process alcohol, from your weight to what you\u2019ve eaten to your sex. Women, for example, are typically more affected by alcohol than men. This occurs because they have a higher proportion of fatty tissue in their bodies, as well as fewer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/alcohol.stanford.edu\/alcohol-drug-info\/buzz-buzz\/factors-affect-how-alcohol-absorbed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alcohol-metabolizing enzymes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than men do. So even if a man and a woman weigh the same, she will likely become intoxicated more quickly from the same amount of alcohol than he will. As well, the effects of alcohol are influenced by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.niaaa.nih.gov\/publications\/aa28.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tolerance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While you may have been a three-glasses-of-wine-a-day gal before your little one was born, nine months of sobriety might mean that half a beer leaves your head spinning these days. Your best bet is to drink in moderation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How long after drinking can I breastfeed again?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the CDC says that breastfeeding about two hours after having a drink should be fine, you may be better off using a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding and alcohol chart <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how long to wait <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeed<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after drinking <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alcohol.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.beststart.org\/resources\/alc_reduction\/pdf\/brstfd_alc_deskref_eng.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motherisk alcohol and breastfeeding chart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one drink every two hours doesn\u2019t apply until you hit 180 pounds. For women who weigh significantly less, 90 pounds for example, they\u2019re looking at closer to three hours a drink to ensure their breast milk contains no alcohol. And keep in mind that alcohol concentration peaks in breast milk <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/vaccinations-medications-drugs\/alcohol.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30-60 minutes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after you\u2019ve had a drink (longer if you\u2019re eating at the same time). So while you may have sobered up, your milk might not have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that your baby isn\u2019t getting the same amount of alcohol that you are. If you breastfeed after a glass of wine, which typically contains 12 percent alcohol, your baby isn\u2019t drinking breast milk with 12 percent alcohol. Even if that glass of wine raises your blood alcohol level to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gc.ca\/eng\/cj-jp\/sidl-rlcfa\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.08<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which is over the legal limit for driving), your baby is still only consuming breast milk which contains 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 mL of fluid. Contrast that with the 14 grams of alcohol typically contained in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.niaaa.nih.gov\/alcohol-health\/overview-alcohol-consumption\/what-standard-drink\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one standard drink<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it\u2019s clear that what you drink is significantly diluted by the time it reaches your baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the side effects of alcohol in breastmilk?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the alcohol you\u2019ve drunk is diluted by the time it reaches them, your baby is still significantly smaller than you are. Their liver is also less developed and less able to process alcohol. So significantly less alcohol can affect them. Newborns are at an especially vulnerable and sensitive stage, so it may be best to wait until your little one is a little older (at least over the one month mark) before drinking and breastfeeding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effects<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of moderate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drinking and breastfeeding on your baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren\u2019t clear. Studies have shown <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/142\/2\/e20174266\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decreased nonverbal reasoning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in six and seven-year-old children of mothers who drank alcohol while breastfeeding. And the more alcohol the mothers reported drinking, the lower their children\u2019s scores. But it\u2019s unclear if these deficits persisted once the children got a little older. Or if they are exactly related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt, however, that heavy use of alcohol while breastfeeding has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501469\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extremely dangerous<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> effects on babies. These include but aren&#8217;t limited to interrupted sleep, seizures, psychomotor delays, inability to rouse from sleep, and a faint pulse.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Effects of alcohol on breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While heavy use of alcohol affects your baby, even moderate amounts of it can affect your body\u2019s production of breast milk, even temporarily <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2802835\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reducing your supply<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Alcohol intake also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/vaccinations-medications-drugs\/alcohol.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases letdown time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the time between when the nipple is stimulated and when the milk flows out). It\u2019s not entirely clear if these factors alone account for why breastfeeding infants drink less milk and nurse for less time after their mother has been drinking. But each of these elements is likely to mean a fussier-than-normal hungry baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Plan ahead<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So given all the fuzzy guidelines, what\u2019s a mom to do? Well, if you want to have a drink, have a drink! Wine, beer, a martini, it\u2019s up to you. But plan ahead. If you can, breastfeed before you drink. Baby can also drink pumped or hand-expressed breast milk so you don\u2019t have to nurse if you drink too much. Drink your beverage slowly, and have a snack to slow down the intoxicating effects. If you have your baby with you, make sure you have a designated \u201cbaby holder\u201d nearby to hand them off to if you feel addled or a little tipsy. Parenting while intoxicated can be extremely dangerous and bumps and falls can be deadly for infants. And under no circumstances should you bed share with your child after you\u2019ve had any amount of alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, \u201cpumping and dumping\u201d isn\u2019t actually helpful. It <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.niaaa.nih.gov\/publications\/arh25-3\/230-234.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn\u2019t decrease<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the amount of alcohol in your milk because it correlates with your blood alcohol level. Much like you, nothing sobers up your breast milk except time. Having said that, if your breasts are uncomfortably full because of missing a feed while drinking, it\u2019s ok to express some milk until you&#8217;re comfortable again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pregnancy means nine months of sobriety, leaving many new moms looking forward to a glass of wine upon delivery. While not drinking if you&#8217;re breastfeeding is your safest option, having the occasional drink is fine. Just make sure to limit yourself to one at a time and don\u2019t drink every day. It might be frustrating, but you only breastfeed for such a short amount of time in your life. It\u2019ll be over before you know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you are concerned about your drinking, please speak with your doctor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can you drink alcohol before breastfeeding your baby?
