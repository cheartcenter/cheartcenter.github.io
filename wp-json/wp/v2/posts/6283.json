Many of the symptoms aren\u2019t specific to thyroid issues, and can masquerade as signs of many other illnesses. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, the symptoms of thyroid disease are easily managed. But you have to know what you\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is the thyroid?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The human thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the front of our neck. It releases hormones called triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), that regulate our metabolism. By manufacturing these hormones, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merckmanuals.com\/en-ca\/home\/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders\/thyroid-gland-disorders\/overview-of-the-thyroid-gland\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thyroid influences the production of proteins<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout our body. It affects almost every tissue in the body, including those that underly our digestion and brain function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the thyroid is working properly, we don\u2019t have to pay very much (if any) attention to it. As long as we\u2019re getting enough iodine in our diet, the thyroid can go on doing what it does without conscious effort from us. But when the thyroid malfunctions, it can throw us off completely. When something goes wrong with our thyroid, it results in hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism: issues with symptoms at opposite ends of the spectrum. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hyperthyroidism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as overactive thyroid, hyperthyroidism is when your thyroid produces too much T3, T4 or both, causing your metabolism to speed up. This can result in weight loss, increased sweating, rapid heart beat, irritability and nervousness, and frequent bowel movements, as well as abnormal periods and dry skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hypothyroidism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one&#8217;s called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-weird-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism-you-might-be-missing\/\">underactive thyroid<\/a> as it occurs when your thyroid isn\u2019t producing enough hormones. For the most part, the symptoms are the opposite of those associated with hyperthyroidism. Instead we see weight gain, frequent feelings of cold, difficulty with memory, depression, constipation, abnormal periods, and brittle hair and nails. If left untreated, long-term effects can include joint pain, infertility and heart disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Thyroid problems in men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many think of thyroid issues as predominantly affecting women, men are also at risk. Like women, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thyroid issues<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in men can cause exhaustion, difficulty concentrating and weight gain or weight loss. Both sexes may also have low libido, but men may also have to deal with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/erectile-dysfunction-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">erectile dysfunction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Men with hypothyroidism may be more likely to experience delayed ejaculation, while those with hyperthyroidism may have a greater risk of premature ejaculation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Thyroid problems in women<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thyroid research and awareness has mainly centred on women, as they&#8217;re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyroid.org\/media-main\/press-room\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five to eight times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more likely to have thyroid problems than men. While many of the symptoms are the same for both sexes, women\u2019s reproductive health can also be affected. For those suffering from an underactive thyroid, for example, one sign may be irregular or heavy periods. In contrast, women with an overactive thyroid may experience light or missed periods. And in pregnant women, hyperthyroidism can be associated with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preeclampsia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, preterm delivery, miscarriage, and developmental issues in their children. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Risk factors for thyroid disease<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk factors<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thyroid problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are both genetic and environmental. This means that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what can cause thyroid problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can range all the way from having an immediate family member with one, to smoking. Obviously, you can\u2019t do anything about your genes, or your age and gender. These are all huge risk factors \u2014 with women over 60 being especially vulnerable to thyroid dysfunction. Women who have been pregnant within the past six months are also at increased risk. Receiving radiation in the chest or neck area or having surgery to treat an overactive thyroid, both increase the chances of developing an underactive thyroid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some lifestyle factors, however, that you can control \u2014 smoking for instance. There is evidence to suggest that those who <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/412797\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smoke<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have a slightly elevated risk of hyperthyroidism, while those who have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyroid.org\/professionals\/ata-publications\/clinical-thyroidology\/december-2012-volume-24-issue-12\/clin-thyroidol-20122410-11\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quit smoking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within the previous two years, may be at increased risk for hypothyroidism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iodine is crucial to the functioning of our thyroid. Since our bodies don\u2019t make it, it\u2019s essential to consume enough iodine for our thyroid to work properly. This isn\u2019t usually a problem in Western countries where we add iodine to our table salt, but in some areas of the world, iodine deficiency is much more common.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The symptoms of thyroid disease can mimic many other illnesses, or even simple ageing! Because of this no specific cluster of symptoms can lead a conclusive diagnosis of thyroid disease. The only way to be sure you have one is to test your levels of thyroid hormones. Luckily, this is easily done with a simple blood test. If you are concerned that your thyroid isn\u2019t working the way it should be, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/features\/lab-work\/\">get in touch<\/a> with us. In Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Nova Scotia, our doctors can requisition the tests you need within minutes so that all you need to do is print the forms and head to a lab near you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment for thyroid disease typically involves taking hormones or other medications. Depending on which version you have, these either suppress or supplement your thyroid\u2019s production of hormones. In the case of hyperthyroidism, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the thyroid, or treatment with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyroid.org\/radioactive-iodine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">radioactive iodine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to destroy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why see an endocrinologist?<\/h2>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/endocrinologist\/\">Endocrinologists<\/a> are doctors who study hormones and treat hormone-based diseases and disorders. If you have symptoms of thyroid issues, you&#8217;ll most likely be referred to an endocrinologist to figure out the right treatment plan. This is especially true if your treatment isn&#8217;t progressing as planned. An endocrinologist will ensure all treatment avenues are pursued to help manage your condition.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can be debilitating, but with proper treatment, you can live a symptom-free life. If you find yourself experiencing any of the symptoms of either, don&#8217;t be shy about speaking with a doctor. Help is just around the corner.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thyroid disease affects one in 10 Canadians, but it&#8217;s estimated 50% don&#8217;t know they have an issue to begin with.
