Unfortunately, more and more people are experiencing persistent anxiety. Especially with COVID-19 and all the complications it\u2019s brought, there are lots of triggers for anxiety these days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting a home workout routine is a powerful way to regain a feeling of control over your life, boost your mood, and improve your overall health. People who exercise regularly are found to be more <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00161\/abstract\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emotionally resilient<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Your mind and your body are connected \u2014 when your body is feeling fit and healthy, your mind gets a boost too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s go through how you can set up a fun, sustainable workout routine at home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The basics of a workout routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well balanced workout routine consists of five parts:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warmup<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardio<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strength exercises<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexibility exercises<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooldown<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you take the time to effectively warm up \u2014 at least five to ten minutes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tips to reduce anxiety through working out<\/h2>\n<h3>Cardio<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts recommend you step up the cardio portion of your workout if you want to reduce anxiety. A common symptom of anxiety is increased heart rate and difficulty breathing. Doing cardio helps lower your resting heart rate over time, and trains your body to breathe during times of stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some great forms of cardio you can do at home are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interval training<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boxing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dancing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stationary bike\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming (if you have a pool)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running (indoors or outdoors)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliptical\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jump rope<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Get equipped<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a lot easier to workout if you have basic equipment like a yoga mat and a good pair of running shoes. Other pieces of equipment, like kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands, can really turn up the muscle burn in your workouts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Be consistent<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts agree that it\u2019s better to workout even for ten minutes each day, rather than for two hours straight once a week. Consistency will help you build endurance gradually, while reducing your chances of injury. Consistency is also critical in helping you form a new habit. If fitness is something new for you, it\u2019s important to stick with it to reap the full benefits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Practice good form<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good form will help you get the most \u201cgains\u201d from your workout. It will also make your workouts much more enjoyable. Here are some tips for good form:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain good posture, with a long straight back, wide shoulders, and keep your gaze straight ahead (not to the floor).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your weight evenly centred between both of your feet.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breathe rhythmically through your workout.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your core engaged with every movement.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good form is more important than lifting heavy weights, or running a super long distance. Practicing good form will help you stay injury-free, and you\u2019ll notice physical benefits sooner into your fitness journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Hydrate well<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being dehydrated can reduce your endurance, and give you headaches while you\u2019re working out. Aim to drink <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.myfitnesspal.com\/the-right-way-to-hydrate-before-during-and-after-a-workout\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8-12 ounces of water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before you start exercising. During your workout, only take small sips of water to prevent muscle cramps. Over the course of your whole day, follow the 8&#215;8 rule: eight glasses of water, eight ounces each.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Try yoga<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of people practice yoga regularly to manage stress and anxiety. Yoga can be the antidote you need to a high-pressure, over-stimulated life. There are no rules around how often you should practice yoga, but a good place to start is once a week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga helps lower your stress response. When doing yoga, you might find your breath starting to calm, your inhales becoming deeper, your heart rate lowering, and your mind noticing all your physiological cues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are some videos from our friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/yyoga.ca\/\">Yyoga<\/a> to help you get started.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Peaceful Yoga for Winding Down \u2014 15 min FLOW YOGA SEQUENCE\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YL2oCbvbRgA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Yoga for an Energy Boost | Power Pick Me Up (15 min)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mnCSlImhq5c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FLOW FOR NEWBIES \u2014 Learn yoga basics!

Everyone seems to be working out as if they\u2019re headed to the next Olympic games. Try not to put pressure on yourself to any standard. Only compare yourself to where you were yesterday, last month, and last year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re feeling tired, achy, and low on motivation, your body might be telling you it needs some rest. Your body needs downtime to recover from your workouts and rebuild muscle. Working out when you\u2019re still fatigued can lead to injury, and stall your fitness results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety is tough to live with, but exercise is a huge help in managing your symptoms. Exercise can improve your physiology, which has a direct impact on anxiety flare ups. There are lots of different types of exercise you can do at home. Be consistent, listen to your body, and find an exercise you love to do. Over time, you\u2019ll notice your mood improving and your stress response decreased.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to talk to a doctor about starting a fitness program safely?
