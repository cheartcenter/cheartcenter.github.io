From Silicon Valley executives to your neighbours next door, it seems like everyone is doing it. Proponents of microdosing claim that it makes you more productive, creative, and open to connecting with others. Some people microdose in place of taking antidepressants, claiming the same benefits while avoiding any of the side effects. But, questions remain. Does microdosing live up to the buzz? If so, are there any risks?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is microdosing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microdosing involves taking a tiny amount of a drug \u2014 somewhere between one tenth to one twentieth of a recreational dose. There\u2019s been a lot of focus recently on microdosing hallucinogens, but you can also microdose other drugs, from cannabis to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/mental-illness-and-addiction-index\/ketamine\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ketamine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The intent with microdosing isn\u2019t to get \u201chigh.\u201d If you begin to hallucinate, you\u2019ve taken too much. Instead, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2019\/may\/03\/psychedelic-drugs-women-taking-tiny-doses-hattie-garlick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proponents claim<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the practice makes them more alert and creative, less anxious, and more open to human interaction. Some practitioners choose to dose themselves monthly, weekly, or multiple times a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are psychedelics?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelics are a class of drugs that change your perceptions. They fall into two categories. The first is \u201cclassic\u201d and includes LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (mushrooms), peyote, and DMT (dimethyltryptamine). The second type is \u201cdissociative\u201d and includes PCP (phencyclidine), ketamine, and salvia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both types can cause auditory and visual hallucinations, causing you to see colours or think your furniture is breathing, for example. Dissociative drugs can also give users an out-of-body or disconnected experience, making them feel out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to hallucinations, psychedelics also heighten feelings, and can make the user feel euphoric and more connected to others. On the flip side, \u201cbad trips\u201d can engender fear and paranoia.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What happens when you microdose?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to predict what will happen when you microdose as there are a lot of variables, beginning with which substance you take. For example, Psilocybin is a much different experience than MDMA. Your circumstances also affect your experience \u2014 everything from the mood you\u2019re in, to the people you\u2019re around, to where you are. Even sensory elements like smell can change your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anecdotal reports from some participants say microdosing makes them feel more creative, energetic, and emotionally open. But because there\u2019s a lack of clinical research on microdosing, it\u2019s impossible to accurately predict what your experience will be like.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is microdosing risky?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. In Canada it\u2019s illegal to buy or possess psychedelic drugs, even when they\u2019re for personal consumption, unless you\u2019ve been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/london\/some-doctors-therapists-get-health-canada-permission-to-use-magic-mushrooms-1.5834485\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">granted special permission<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This legal status means that there\u2019s no oversight in the drug production facilities. No one knows what conditions psychedelic drugs are made under. It also makes it impossible to guarantee what a drug contains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with pre-legal cannabis <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/edibles-versus-smoking-cannabis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edibles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, no oversight also means that the dosage of the drug is potentially inexact. One dose of acid paper could have significantly more drug on it than another, for instance. This could result in a user taking significantly more than they intended to. We know that in high doses certain psychedelics can be quite dangerous. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/publications\/drugfacts\/hallucinogens\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negative effects<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can include memory loss, seizures, trouble breathing, and even death. Given that drug source and concentration are unknown, users must always consider the possibility of drug overdose.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is microdosing psychologically harmful?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The short answer is that we don\u2019t really know. Those with existing psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia or anxiety, shouldn\u2019t take psychedelics. There\u2019s a link between taking psychedelics and the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3024828\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">onset of psychosis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so these drugs aren\u2019t safe in any amount if you&#8217;re at risk. Some individuals who use psychedelics develop <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3425\/8\/3\/47\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (HPPD), also known as flashbacks. Risk factors for developing this disorder are unknown, as is the amount of drug use that triggers it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anecdotally, some people report taking psychedelics recreationally and enjoying the experience. For those who take psychedelics and have a bad experience, however, it can be really bad. In one study, almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27578767\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of participants said that their bad psychedelic trip was one of the most psychologically difficult experiences of their life. In certain individuals, the experience correlated with suicide attempts, while in others it led to enduring psychological issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are there medical benefits to microdosing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microdosing psychedelics gets its fair share of good press.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4592297\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research suggests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that some psychedelics might be beneficial when it comes to treating depression, alcohol use disorder, PTSD, or anxiety. These studies have been in highly controlled research settings, however, with participants taking larger doses than a typical microdose.\u00a0 When it comes to microdosing, there\u2019s yet to be a<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">single controlled research study on the effects. Doctors and scientists don\u2019t know what microdosing does to a person on a physical or psychological level in either the short or long-term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Favourable reports on treating mental health conditions with psychedelics have inspired some to try their own hand at it. But it\u2019s important to use caution if you are considering this yourself. There\u2019s a perception that taking a tiny quantity of drug avoids any of its potential side effects. To date, there have been<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> zero <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research trials on microdosing. Taking minute amounts of mushrooms might seem harmless, but these are powerful drugs and the effects on your brain and body are unknown. If you\u2019re interested in microdosing, your best bet is to wait for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.utm.utoronto.ca\/psychedelics\/welcome-psychedelic-studies-research-program-utm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the science to catch up<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before you try it. You likely won\u2019t have too wait long.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microdosing psychedelics is a hot topic right now.
