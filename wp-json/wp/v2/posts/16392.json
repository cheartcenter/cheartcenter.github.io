It\u2019s an illness that\u2019s hard on your body and can be fatal. That\u2019s why breast cancer screening is so important.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screening is when you periodically check for an illness in someone who seems otherwise healthy. When it comes to breast cancer, it\u2019s a<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> life-saving practice. Screening helps you understand how likely you are to develop breast cancer by weighing risks like lifestyle habits and genetics. That way, you can hopefully discover cancer in early stages when it\u2019s most treatable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If breast cancer is caught early, doctors can intervene before it\u2019s had a chance to spread. Even if you\u2019re young and don\u2019t have any health problems, it\u2019s still a good idea to go for routine breast cancer screenings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who needs to get breast cancer screening?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors like life stage and family history are considerations when deciding if breast cancer screening is right for you. Your doctor will look at the following when making a decision:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your age. Chances of breast cancer increase as you get older. For women over 50, guidelines advise screening by mammography every <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/canadiantaskforce.ca\/guidelines\/published-guidelines\/breast-cancer-update\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2-3 years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal and family history of cancer. Women who&#8217;ve had breast cancer before are more likely to develop cancer again. If a close relative has had breast cancer, you\u2019re at higher risk.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle factors. Drinking alcohol, smoking, and being overweight may contribute to cancer development.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genetics. Some women carry genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Both are mutations that cause ovarian and breast cancer.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast cancer screening tests<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your doctor has considered your risk factors, you should jointly decide whether to go ahead with screening. If you choose to proceed with screening, these tests are typically recommended:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinical examinations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a clinical examination a doctor conducts a manual and visual exam of the breast. They\u2019ll check for lumps and look for abnormalities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mammogram<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mammogram is a low energy x-ray that takes a picture of the breast. They\u2019re especially helpful in catching breast cancer early. They\u2019re often able to detect lumps in the breast that are still too small for doctors to feel through palpation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast MRI<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a test where multiple images of your breast are taken at different angles. Then they\u2019re put together to show a complete picture of your breast. Doctors usually recommend MRIs after it\u2019s been confirmed that breast cancer is present through a biopsy. The full-circle picture helps them get a better idea of how advanced the cancer is so they can recommend proper treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-examination<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re familiar with the look and feel of your breasts when you\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s easier to tell when something is off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do a self exam in three easy steps:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Look<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stand in front of a mirror with your arms at your sides. Then, raise your arms above your head while paying close attention to each breast. Turn so that you can see your profile in the mirror and repeat the same motions. Last, stand facing the mirror with hands on hips. Tighten your chest muscles and move your shoulders forward slowly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Feel <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove your shirt and lay down. Then, raise your right arm over your head and slide a pillow under the right shoulder. With the pads of your three middle fingers on your other hand, start at the outer edge of your breast and move in circles with varying pressure. Start out light, and progress to medium and firm pressure. Check around your collarbone, and in the area between your breast and underarm. Do the same on the other side.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Compress <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gently feel around your nipples, squeezing lightly to check for any discharge. Keep an eye out for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lumps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin dimpling<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardened tissue<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nipple retraction<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unusual shape<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swelling<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nipple retraction\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Should you examine your own breasts?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s controversy around whether breast self-examination is really a good idea. On one hand, it\u2019s free and convenient to examine your own breasts at home. Breast self-examinations can help some women feel more empowered about their health, particularly if they have hereditary risk factors. On the other hand, breast self-examinations haven\u2019t been shown to lower breast cancer mortality rates. Plus, they can encourage over-vigilance, unnecessary doctor\u2019s visits, and over-treatment. Cancer treatment is very physically and mentally taxing, and going through the oncology system for a false positive can be scarring.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Canadian Task Force <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw3791\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends against<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> breast self-examinations, but at the end of the day it\u2019s your choice when it comes to your own body. The key is to make an informed decision, weighing all the pros and cons as they relate to your health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The downside to breast cancer screening<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While screening can be a useful way to catch cancer early, it comes with its own set of risks:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">False positives. This is when a doctor thinks cancer is present when it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s scary for the person who is misdiagnosed, and can lead to unnecessary treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">False negatives. When this happens, a negative test result is produced even though cancer is present. For example, x-rays can sometimes miss lumps in the breast that turn out to be cancerous.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over-diagnosis. This is when early treatment is given for cancer that would never have become severe. In this scenario, the benefits of being screened outweigh the risks. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/csbi.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/CSBI_Statement_CTFPHC_Dec_2018_FINAL.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of breast cancer treatment is a result of overdiagnosis. But, women who don\u2019t get screening are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/csbi.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/CSBI_Statement_CTFPHC_Dec_2018_FINAL.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more likely to die from breast cancer.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What to do if you find a lump in your breast<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a lump in your breast is understandably scary. It\u2019s important to see your doctor, but try not to worry too much. Benign lumps are common too, so finding a lump doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have breast cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screening and self examinations are two excellent ways to catch breast cancer early. With your doctor\u2019s help you can identify the best tests for you, and how often you\u2019ll need to do them. Making breast cancer screening a priority is a life-saving decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, or you want to better understand your personal risk factors, an oncology navigator can help.
