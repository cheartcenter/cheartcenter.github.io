Obviously laughter can\u2019t compete with vaccines or chemotherapy when it comes to medical treatment. But it turns out that laughter is pretty good for you \u2014 whether you\u2019re sick or not. So here are five ways to laugh more every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is laughter really the best medicine?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While &#8220;laughter is the best medicine&#8221; may be a folksy idiom, laughter is undeniably beneficial. Laughter <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lung.ca\/blog\/love-laughter-and-lungs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases your oxygen intake<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is good for just about every part of the body. It can even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/267434#Education\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase your pain tolerance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can help lower your perceived level of chronic pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, laughter is good for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mbwpg.cmha.ca\/news\/positive-mental-health-is-a-laughing-matter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mental health<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fighting stress, and<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/12652882\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boost the function of your immune system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And the best part of laughter? There\u2019s no downside to adding it to your life. Here\u2019s how to inject a little humour into your every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Spend time with funny people<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have a resident comedian in your household at the moment, there are a few other ways to go outside of your bubble for a laugh. Book a regular phone call or video chat with your funniest friend. Start a group chat where no-holds-barred humour is encouraged. While we may not know our favourite podcasters personally, they certainly feel like friends when we listen to their silly tales in the comfort of our living rooms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Have a child explain stuff to you\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a reason \u201cKids Say The Darndest Things\u201d was a hit in multiple countries. Asking a preschooler to explain something to you \u2014 how a bicycle works, what their parents do for a living, basically anything \u2014 is entertaining and hilarious. So whether you have your own child or get the chance to prattle with a young family member, try tapping into the natural humour of toddlers. They\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to keep you in stitches.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Take humour breaks throughout the day\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give doom scrolling a rest and consume something funny instead. Whether it\u2019s visiting <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theoatmeal.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Oatmeal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> once a day, or watching your favourite comedian\u2019s Netflix special, make a purposeful point of seeking out some funny content. The news can get pretty grim, and reading the same negative stuff over and over can send you into a spiral. Let Eddie Murphy or Amy Schumer clear out some of those mental cobwebs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Follow someone funny on social media\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re a lawyer, a millennial, or a sleep-deprived parent, there\u2019s a funny Twitter or Instagram account out there that understands your struggle. Consuming social media excessively can fuel <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpguide.org\/articles\/mental-health\/social-media-and-mental-health.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and negative self-image. However, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/news\/features\/social-media-positive-mental-health\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suggests that mindful social media use can be beneficial, as long as we don\u2019t take it too seriously. So find an account that makes you laugh and check in whenever you need a little pick-me-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Think about laughing\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19250162\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows that paralyzing your frowning muscles with Botox might actually make you happier \u2014 and even combat <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/depression-signs-and-symptoms-how-to-recognize-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It turns out that your brain doesn\u2019t differentiate between what your face is doing and how you feel. A resting grumpy face actually makes your brain feel upset, even if nothing is necessarily going wrong.\u00a0 So take a minute to remember the last thing that made you laugh, and you might feel a corresponding boost in your mood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could even try your hand at keeping a laughter journal to jot down anything humorous you encounter in your day. Alternatively, focus on making other people laugh. Does doing a funny voice for your dog make your partner giggle uncontrollably? Few things are more rewarding than coaxing a chuckle out of someone else. And it turns out that we instinctively <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/11408051\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mirror the expressions of others<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So go ahead and try to elicit a smile or a chuckle from someone else. You\u2019ll likely find that what you give out comes back to you in spades. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is laughter really the best medicine?
