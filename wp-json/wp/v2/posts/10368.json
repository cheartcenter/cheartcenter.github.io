The respiratory illness, which has <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over three million confirmed cases so far,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> started in Wuhan City, China and has since moved through China\u2019s busy airports to countries around the world, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As of this week, it&#8217;s been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s everything you need to know about coronavirus, from signs and symptoms, to how likely it is that you\u2019ll catch the virus yourself. (Hint: with the information we have now, the risk is much lower than you may think.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is coronavirus?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually refers to a group of viruses, including the common cold and flu. The trouble with coronaviruses is that they\u2019re hard to treat because they vary so much from one virus to the next. They also vary from season to season, so figuring out a catch-all cure is difficult.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 \u2014 what everyone is simply calling \u201ccoronavirus\u201d right now \u2014 is a new virus in the coronavirus family, so there is still a lot we don\u2019t know about how it spreads, and how to treat it. We do know that it\u2019s comparable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in that all 3 are coronaviruses that cause flu-like symptoms in people. This doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re the same though. They all have varying rates of mortality, and at this stage,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it isn\u2019t proven that coronavirus is as dangerous as SARS or MERS.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the symptoms of coronavirus?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">difficulty breathing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pneumonia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">headache<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sore throat<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a ge<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eral feeling of being unwell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re experiencing these symptoms and you\u2019ve traveled outside Canada in the last two weeks, you\u2019re at higher risk for having coronavirus. Similarly, if someone you came into contact with is ill and has returned from outside Canada in the last 14 days, there\u2019s an increased risk that you\u2019ve been exposed to coronavirus through them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you have the above symptoms and you\u2019ve travelled in the last two weeks, it\u2019s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/travel.gc.ca\/travelling\/advisories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check the latest travel advice and advisories<\/a> to determine whether you should be concerned.<b> If you think you have coronavirus, contact your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.gov.on.ca\/en\/common\/system\/services\/phu\/locations.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local public health unit<\/a> for further direction and testing.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Residents of Ontario with OHIP coverage can also access our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\">COVID-19 screening service<\/a> or contact Telehealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) for more instructions. To avoid the spread of infection, do not go to clinic or hospital before calling. You should also consider wearing a mask to protect yourself and others if you believe you have coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our CEO, Dr. Brett Belchetz, recently stopped by Breakfast Television to talk more about these masks, along with other common questions on coronavirus:<\/p>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 56.156%; position: relative;\"><iframe class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\" style=\"border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bttoronto.ca\/video\/iframe\/2226196965001\/SkX1bBGY\/6128622080001\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is coronavirus spread?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, we aren\u2019t certain. However, scientists believe that like other respiratory illnesses, coronavirus probably moves from one person to the next through the spread of droplets expelled when someone coughs or sneezes. When droplets containing the virus spread through the air, they can be inhaled by people nearby, causing infection. Those same droplets can land on surfaces like door handles or counter tops, and live there until someone else picks them up on their hands. If that person touches their nose or mouth before cleaning their hands, just like that, the virus can spread to them too. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/coronavirus-zoonosis-1.5440146\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suggest coronavirus may also spread from livestock to humans living in highly affected areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of other important facts researchers are still exploring, like whether or not everyone infected with coronavirus actually gets sick, and how long someone with the virus should be quarantined before it\u2019s safe for them to mingle with the general public again.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is coronavirus treated?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the moment, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus. That\u2019s why prevention is so important. Here\u2019s what you can do to minimize your risk of infection:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.

The information will help medical staff make the most informed decision about how best to treat you or your family member.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading to a doctor\u2019s office or emergency room increases your chances of exposure.
