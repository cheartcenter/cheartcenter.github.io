Kids need medical attention at each stage of their lives to make sure they\u2019re developing properly. It truly does take a village, and a team of healthcare experts, to raise a child.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wondering what medical checkup schedule to follow for your child, or want a simple guide for easy reference, we\u2019ve laid it out below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infants and toddlers<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3>Infancy<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wellness checkup, 3-5 days after birth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A healthcare provider should examine your baby within a week of birth.

That\u2019s why your family doctor or pediatrician will need to see your baby a lot, even if they receive a clean bill of health each time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Well-child visits<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health checkups, age 1-30 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-child visits are regular doctor\u2019s visits that ensure your child is healthy, developing normally, and is up-to-date with immunizations. They\u2019re carried out when your child is:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One month old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nine months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12 months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15 months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18 months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24 months old<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 months old<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-child visits last only 10-20 minutes. They\u2019re meant to be quick check-ins between your child and their doctor. During the visit, the doctor will discuss your child\u2019s eating and sleeping habits, how they\u2019re doing emotionally, and whether they\u2019re developing socially and physically at a typical pace for their age. The doctor will perform a physical examination of heart function, reflexes, temperature, and check for certain conditions like jaundice. Your child will also receive vaccines during their well-child visit according to their immunization schedule.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/provincial-territorial-immunization-information\/provincial-territorial-routine-vaccination-programs-infants-children.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here to view the provincial and territorial routine and catch-up vaccination schedule for infants and children in Canada.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Childhood<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yearly checkups, 3-5 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids become much more autonomous in the 3-5 year age range. They can walk, talk, and run around your home with seemingly unlimited energy. Kids in this age group can transition to yearly checkups if they\u2019re showing good health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many new things a young child can do. They\u2019re learning to use the bathroom themselves, form social groups, and take part in conversations. It\u2019s important for their doctor to maintain supervision to see if they\u2019re developing on schedule. Set up a doctor\u2019s appointment if your child is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstfiveyears.org.au\/child-development\/child-development-milestones-3-to-5-years#:~:text=Child%20development%20milestones%3A%203%2D5%20yrs,-Child%20Development&amp;text=From%20ages%203%20to%205,social%20skills%20and%20make%20friends.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showing any of these signs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their speech isn\u2019t understood by others.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have trouble speaking their birth language fluently.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re playing aggressively with other children, or don\u2019t want to play at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The child is unable to have a conversation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your child can\u2019t use the toilet or wash themselves.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child displays any of the above signs, they may need a specialist to support them in a certain area. For example, many young children need speech therapists to develop their elocution skills and their confidence speaking publicly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Otherwise, yearly health checkups are fine for kids between three and five years of age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Checkups every 1-2 years, five years and older<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After five years, if your child receives a clean bill of health, they can transition to health checkups every 1-2 years. Your child\u2019s doctor will be the best person to decide on the frequency of appointments at this stage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-teens and teenagers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of physical and emotional changes kids deal with as they enter adolescence. The following appointments are recommended to ensure young patients are developing on-track.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Checkups every 1-2 years, between 13 and 18 years old<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checkups are still an important part of an adolescent&#8217;s healthcare schedule. Your child\u2019s primary caregiver can tell whether there are developmental or mental health concerns to be addressed. During the checkup, your child\u2019s doctor will perform a physical examination, measuring height, weight, blood pressure, and reflexes. The doctor will also keep an eye out for conditions like depression, eating disorders, and signs of substance abuse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, your child should start to see their doctor alone. This allows young patients to build a trusting relationship with their healthcare provider. This will come in handy as they mature and have questions about sexuality, drugs and alcohol, and physical health concerns. Some doctors recommend that patients receive privacy during their health appointments <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yourteenmag.com\/health\/physical-health\/teen-health-doctor-appointment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starting at the age of 12 years old<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It may be appropriate to give your kid privacy at an even earlier age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Gynecology appointment, between 13 and 15 years old<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When gynecologists meet young patients, they don\u2019t necessarily perform a pelvic examination or do any swabbing. So, if your daughter is worried about that, she can rest easy that her first gynecologist appointment will be more like a conversation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gynecologists educate young patients about sexual health, the developmental stages of puberty, and when to be concerned about difficult periods. They may also talk about menstrual irregularity, infections such as UTIs, and risky sexual behaviours.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Mental health appointment<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While mental health appointments aren\u2019t strictly necessary, they\u2019re a very good idea for every young person. It never hurts for kids to talk about any emotional issues they\u2019re facing with a neutral, compassionate person.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adolescence is a tough period of life. Kids are expected to mature rapidly and embrace \u201ccool\u201d behaviours to keep up with their cliques. Add hormones to the mix and it\u2019s no wonder teenagers are often stressed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s more, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/adolescent-mental-health#:~:text=Half%20of%20all%20mental%20health,%2D19%2Dyear%2Dolds.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">half of all mental health conditions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> start by the age of 14. Most cases are undetected and untreated. If left untreated, mental illness can cause people to withdraw from society and turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like drugs and alcohol. This can alter the course of a teenager\u2019s growth and success as an adult.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if a teenager isn\u2019t showing warning signs of mental illness, it\u2019s good preventative practice to see a therapist at least once. Mental health professionals can help young people process difficult emotions, offer healthy coping skills, and help teenagers love and accept themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Get some extra help<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When everything is said and done, both parents and children will spend a lot of time in the doctor\u2019s office. It\u2019s important for kids and teens to build a healthy relationship with their healthcare providers. This will make them more inclined to participate in regular preventative healthcare as an adult.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids can be little balls of health and energy, but sometimes they come down with some nasty illnesses. If you want to get a physician\u2019s or pediatrician\u2019s advice, you can talk to our doctors from the comfort of your home, on your schedule.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When should you take your child to see their doctor, and how often?
