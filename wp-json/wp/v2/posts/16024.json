This year is different. It\u2019s more important than ever that Canadians get their flu shot. But where should you go for a flu shot if you\u2019re working from home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flu shot is a vaccine that\u2019s redeveloped every year to protect against different variations of influenza, which are called strains. Scientists predict which strains will be the most common during the upcoming flu season, and include them in the vaccine that\u2019s administered to the public. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 the flu shot only contains dead or weak samples of each strain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many employers set up temporary flu shot clinics at their offices. That is, of course, when offices are open. With many people still working from home, they\u2019ll have to find other ways to get the flu shot this year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is getting a flu shot important?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flu is serious business. It can put you on the sidelines for weeks recovering, and lead to severe medical complications. In Canada, the seasonal flu <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/flu-influenza\/health-professionals.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is responsible for approximately<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you sail through recovery just fine, getting the flu shot is still important for protecting people who are at higher risk for complications. This group includes senior citizens, those with underlying health conditions, young children, and pregnant women. When you get the flu shot, you\u2019re at lower risk of spreading the flu.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn\u2019t an ordinary year for the flu due to COVID-19. Experts say that it\u2019s doubly important to get the flu shot this year. By getting the flu shot, you\u2019ll be able to discern whether illness symptoms that pop up are related to the seasonal flu or COVID-19. If you\u2019ve already had the flu shot, any onset of fever and dry cough are more likely to signal COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there\u2019s the strain on our healthcare system, which we should always keep in mind. If there\u2019s another spike in COVID-19 cases, we\u2019ll need to ensure there are enough empty hospital beds to accommodate new patients. If we\u2019re also dealing with a heavy flu season at that time, we run the risk of overrunning our hospitals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s even more worrying, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7213830\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there have been cases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of patients getting the seasonal flu and COVID-19 at the same time. The common theme with COVID-19 is uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what to expect when people get both diseases. It\u2019s better not to experiment with your health, so get your flu shot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can you get the flu shot during COVID-19?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pharmacies\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In normal years, approximately 35% of flu shots are given at local pharmacies. That figure is expected to rise this year as doctor\u2019s clinics may not be able to accommodate so many patients. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca\/en\/health-and-pharmacy\/pharmacy-services\/flu-shot\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoppers Drug Mart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a mailing list to notify you when the flu shot is ready. You\u2019ll even get 500 Optimum points for signing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor\u2019s clinics<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your family doctor or local walk-in clinic can give you the flu shot once it\u2019s been distributed to your province. This year, with physical distancing, clinics will probably schedule flu shot appointments to avoid having too many people sitting in their waiting rooms. That might mean that clinics won\u2019t be able to give the flu shot to as many patients as usual.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public health clinics\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many Canadian towns and cities have public clinics for matters like sexual health, harm reduction, and primary health for lower-income people. You can get the flu shot at many of these clinics, but it\u2019s a good idea to call ahead first to confirm they\u2019re offering the vaccine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offices\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your employer has reopened their office space, they may set up a mobile flu shot clinic this year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When should you get the flu shot?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Public Health Agency of Canada has stated the flu shot should be ready at its normal time this year, late September to early October. You should get the flu shot as early as possible once it\u2019s available.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes about two weeks for your body to create antibodies to fight the flu once you\u2019ve received the vaccine. Flu season is well underway by November, so you\u2019ll want your antibodies going at full strength by then. The flu season peaks in January or February.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it safe to get the flu shot during COVID-19?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a word, yes. The flu shot does not put you at higher risk of contracting either COVID-19, or the seasonal flu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines are specific in their effects. If this weren\u2019t the case, we would have one vaccine for all respiratory diseases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what if the vaccine for COVID-19 is miraculously developed, tested, and ready for the public this flu season? You can still get both vaccines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety precautions for getting the flu shot during COVID-19<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expect that medical staff will be wearing plenty of personal protective equipment when you go get your flu shot. You should do the same and wear a face mask, use hand sanitizer regularly, and maintain physical distance from staff and other patients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before getting your flu shot. If you have a fever, or may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, you may be asked to come back after self-quarantining.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies under six months old are too young for the flu shot. Kids over six months are great candidates though. That\u2019s because kids are \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the flu. By inoculating kids, that\u2019s a big step towards preventing the flu from spreading through communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have questions about getting the flu shot?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want some good news for a change? Flu numbers are at record lows this year. That\u2019s because our collective measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have also helped prevent the flu from spreading. Washing our hands, wearing face masks, and physical distancing are useful for slowing the spread of most diseases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t take that as a green light to skip your flu shot. It\u2019s an easy and effective way to help keep Canada healthy as we enter into the chilly fall and winter seasons. How we cope with the fall and winter seasons will set us up for ultimate recovery from COVID-19. Let\u2019s keep going strong.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many Canadians get their annual flu shot at mobile clinics at their workplace.
