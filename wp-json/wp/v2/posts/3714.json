But the truth is,\u00a0gift cards can be some of the most thoughtful presents.<\/p>\n<h3>Why give a gift card?<\/h3>\n<p>You probably don\u2019t think there\u2019s a science to gifting, but give <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/globe-investor\/personal-finance\/household-finances\/ask-a-behavioural-economist-is-it-better-to-give-cash-or-gift-cards\/article37410364\/\">this article<\/a> by a behavioural economist a read and you might change your mind. There are many reasons for why\u00a0giving a gift card is a good choice. That\u2019s because when it comes to shopping, gift cards remove the guilt from spending on yourself. Life is expensive, and while many of us are willing to be generous towards our nearest and dearest, it\u2019s hard for us to do the same for ourselves. Gift cards remove that guilt. When someone gives you a gift card, the money is already spent. When you give a gift card, you give the other person license to spend on themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the same kind of psychology doesn\u2019t apply with cash. Even when they are given money, many people feel guilty about spending it on themselves. Giving a gift card gives them permission \u2014 you\u2019ve already spent it, they just have to use it!<\/p>\n<h3>What gift card should I get?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re buying for someone close, it makes sense to choose a gift card from their favourite store. But if you don\u2019t know the person that well, or if they\u2019re \u201cimpossible\u201d to buy for, it can be a little more difficult. In those cases, you\u2019ll want to get a gift card for something that\u2019s going to appeal to everyone, and that\u2019s where we come in. That\u2019s right, our gift cards are here to help you with your gift-giving dilemmas. Our gift cards let you give the gift of Canadian health care to family or friends, ensuring they have no excuse to avoid seeing the doctor next time they&#8217;re sick.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I purchase a Maple gift card?<\/h3>\n<p>The process is simple, but you\u2019re going to need a user account to begin. If you don\u2019t have one, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/register\">click here<\/a> to register. If you already have an account, simply log in and select the \u201ceGift cards\u201d option in the purple menu on the left side of the page. Next, pick the amount you want. Gift cards start at $50 and increase in $25 increments, but you can also choose a custom amount that suits your needs better. Once you\u2019ve chosen the denomination, go ahead and press \u201cselect\u201d and presto, you\u2019ve done it. You\u2019ll have the option of emailing it right away with a personalized\u00a0message, or downloading a PDF to print at home.<\/p>\n<h3>What can I use the gift card for?<\/h3>\n<p>So glad you asked! They can be used towards any of our services: a therapy consult, credit packs, memberships, or to see a doctor. If we offer it, you can use our gift card for it.<\/p>\n<h3>Who would I buy it for?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m sure you have some great ideas for this one, but here are a couple more. Is your daughter planning an epic trip around the world? Our gift cards go a long way towards making sure she gets the health care she needs, even if she doesn\u2019t speak the language. Remember, she can use it to access a Canadian doctor on her trip to Peru, or Kenya, or wherever she\u2019s going. Or maybe you have a family member who doesn\u2019t have a doctor nearby. Our gift cards give them the opportunity to speak to a physician directly, without a long drive or hours spent in the waiting room.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re likely reading this because you love the convenience of our services. Maybe you\u2019ve even told your nearest and dearest about it. This is your opportunity to go one step further and show them what they\u2019re missing. So go ahead and relax this year. We\u2019ve got your gift giving covered.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holidays are coming \u2014 and many of us are scrambling to find presents for everyone on our list.
