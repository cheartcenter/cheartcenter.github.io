We know that vaccines save lives. But things have changed so much that many are wondering if they should really be taking their little ones to a busy doctor\u2019s office and risking COVID-19 infection. Do the benefits of vaccines and preventative care outweigh the risks of leaving home? We\u2019ve got the facts to help you make the decision that\u2019s right for your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should I take my child for a check-up during the lockdown?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many doctor&#8217;s offices aren&#8217;t open for visits at the moment. For clinics that have re-opened, they may be operating on adjusted hours and with extra measures like increased protective equipment and physical distancing rules. Fortunately, most issues you visit the doctor for are treatable with telemedicine. When it comes to infants, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/baby-vaccination-in-canada-what-you-need-to-know\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">routine vaccinations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or children with certain conditions, paediatricians may want to physically examine the patient. But no matter the issue, you should still be able to access <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medical care<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the pandemic. Just make sure to call your doctor\u2019s office ahead of time since some clinics aren\u2019t accepting walk-in visits right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can I vaccinate my baby during COVID-19?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you can vaccinate your baby during the COVID-19 pandemic depends on whether your doctor is accepting any in-person visits right now.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep patients out of the office, other paediatricians are mostly seeing patients remotely, while operating drive-through vaccination clinics out of their parking lots. This way, healthcare workers wearing PPE can administer vaccines without putting being in a confined space with a potentially infected person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other doctor&#8217;s offices are still running in-person visits \u2014 though obviously it\u2019s not \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d In these cases, doctors aren\u2019t seeing sick patients, as the risk of spreading infection is too high. Instead, they\u2019re seeing patients mostly through online or telephone visits, with exceptions for certain things that must be done in person, like vaccines. In this case, their office should be more than happy to explain the safety precautions they\u2019re taking for in-person visits. Likely that means more cleaning and limiting the number of patients in the office at one time. They should also be pre-screening patients to ensure no one with COVID-19 symptoms enters the office, and asking that no more than one person accompanies the child. Staff should also be wearing full protective equipment including gloves and masks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Will staying at home protect my unvaccinated child?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since COVID-19 is keeping us all at home, you might assume that this protects us from vaccine-preventable illnesses too. But the truth is more complex. Now that some schools have re-opened<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s possible that vaccine-preventable illnesses like measles will begin circulating again. And just because we\u2019re facing the threat of COVID-19, doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have another outbreak at the same time. Congo, for example, had a measles outbreak at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in 2019. Measles is so contagious, that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/transmission.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of unvaccinated people who come into contact with an infected person will get it. In Congo, that meant that 6,000 people ended up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/measles-congo-1.5418106\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dying from measles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in that outbreak \u2014 more than from Ebola.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While staying home may lower your risk of getting measles, it won\u2019t guard against other vaccine-preventable illnesses, like tetanus. The bacteria that causes tetanus is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/immunization\/monitoring_surveillance\/burden\/vpd\/surveillance_type\/passive\/tetanus\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found everywhere<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including in dirt. So isolating from other people does nothing to protect unvaccinated children from getting it. And getting vaccinated for tetanus is non-negotiable. There\u2019s no cure for tetanus, and it can cause spasms, affects your breathing, and even results in death.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>If I don&#8217;t vaccinate during COVID-19 can my child catch up?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s not advisable, you can wait to vaccinate your child once things start to open up again. If you decide not to vaccinate your child during the COVID-19 pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they catch up on any missing vaccinations once restrictions ease. For herd immunity to work, most of the population has to be vaccinated: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/immunization\/sage\/meetings\/2017\/october\/2._target_immunity_levels_FUNK.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">93-95%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for measles, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/nova\/article\/herd-immunity\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80-85%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for polio. If many parents don\u2019t vaccinate during the pandemic, the number of unvaccinated children swells, increasing the risk of an outbreak. Because of this, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s Chief Public Health Officer, has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CPHO_Canada\/status\/1254407671119216646\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vocal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that parents should continue to vaccinate their children during the pandemic. No other measure is as effective at preventing severe illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to believe how much has changed in the last few months. We\u2019re all focused on COVID-19 \u2014 and for good reason \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that other illnesses have gone away. Ask your doctor for specifics if you\u2019re feeling anxious about staying up-to-date with your child\u2019s vaccines right now. They should be able to set your mind at ease on how they\u2019re keeping their patients safe.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The pandemic has changed everything leaving
