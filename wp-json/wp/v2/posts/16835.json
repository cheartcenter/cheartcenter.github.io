It\u2019s normal to occasionally feel unmotivated when it comes to sex. However, if your libido is consistently lower than you\u2019d like it to be, it\u2019s worth investigating the cause. There are mental and physical reasons for fluctuations in sex drive, so low libido can be a sign that something is awry with your health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libido and mental health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your mental health has an impact on your physical body. If your sex drive isn\u2019t feeling particularly revved, it may be because of mental stressors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living with depression is more than just feeling sad. It\u2019s a prolonged period of low mood. Feeling chronically down can affect your personal relationships. Understandably, it\u2019s harder to connect with other people when you\u2019re feeling withdrawn, tired, and worried. Intimacy is all about interpersonal connection, so depression can decrease your motivation for sex.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s common for people with depression to stop enjoying things that used to make them happy, including sex. Yet, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/fast-facts-about-mental-illness#.VUpsJ_lVhBc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">49%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people with depression don\u2019t go to see their doctor. Symptoms of depression include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling deeply sad, close to tears or hopeless every day for two weeks or more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slower body movements, speech, and thinking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes in your sleep patterns, either sleeping too much or experiencing insomnia.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unexplained physical aches and pains.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequent thoughts of death or suicide.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0If you notice your sex drive is low and you have other symptoms of depression, your doctor can help. They can give a thorough assessment to figure out the root physical and mental causes of low libido. They may also order blood work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With anxiety, your worries are stuck in overdrive. It\u2019s natural to be stressed when you\u2019ve moved cities, are giving a speech, or have a close call while driving. But when you have ongoing anxiety, it can be hard to stay in the moment and enjoy yourself during sex.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body is in a state of stress when you\u2019re anxious, triggering the release of adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones cause your blood vessels to dilate. When it comes to sex, this especially affects men. The restricted blood flow can make it difficult to maintain an erection.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of people who have had trouble becoming aroused with a partner feel discouraged. This can turn sex into one of many triggers for anxious feelings. Embarrassment leads to a repeated cycle of unwanted outcomes, where nerves cause your body to tense up, which stops you from getting turned on. To break the cycle, try <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uofmhealth.org\/health-library\/uz2255\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breathing techniques<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to calm anxiety. They can help you get out of your head and into a state of relaxation \u2014 both inside and outside the bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormones, age, and your sex drive<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormones play an essential role in your sexual health, from your teenage years to late in life. As you get older it\u2019s natural for your sex drive to fluctuate, and even decrease. Hormone levels do the same thing, and their fluctuation affects your libido.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrogen and testosterone are the main hormones that impact your ability to become aroused. In women, estrogen is responsible for sexual desire as well as the physical effects that follow, like vaginal lubrication. When estrogen levels are low, sex drive can decrease. Low estrogen can also lead to painful sex because your body isn\u2019t producing lubricant. Naturally, both of these things can make sex less appealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In men, testosterone plays an important role in sex drive and the ability to maintain erections. If you\u2019re feeling unmotivated when it comes to sex or you\u2019re experiencing erectile dysfunction, it could be a sign your testosterone levels are too low.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your hormones are shifting, it\u2019s absolutely natural to want to enjoy sex in your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/deepblue.lib.umich.edu\/bitstream\/handle\/2027.42\/143212\/NPHA-Sexual-Health-Report_050118_final.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">older years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are lots of ways to rebalance your hormones, from hormone therapy to lifestyle changes in areas like diet or exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libido and lifestyle choices<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying the occasional treat. A glass of wine with friends or a sweet dessert once in a while won\u2019t impact your long-term health. However, some habitual lifestyle choices do have lasting effects on the body, and lower libido is one of them. If your sex drive is sluggish, these habits might be the culprit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, the nicotine in cigarettes causes your blood vessels to constrict and become less elastic. This makes it harder for blood to circulate around your body. For both men and women, blood flow to sexual organs is an essential part of arousal. Especially for men, poor circulation lowers libido by causing erectile dysfunction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/-\/media\/files\/canadas-low-risk-guidelines-pdf.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessive drinking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can cause long-term erectile dysfunction in men. Drinking alcohol causes nerve damage that results in decreased sensitivity. In women, dehydration from excessive drinking can make it difficult to produce vaginal lubricant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of exercise\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a host of ways exercise benefits physical wellness, including libido. Exercise improves your general mood through releasing endorphins, leaving you feeling happier and more playful. Exercise also helps maintain hormonal balance. Plus, staying in shape boosts confidence in your physical appearance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trouble with sex can be a frustrating experience. No matter what is preventing you from having the sex life you want, there are lots of ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/four-ways-to-boost-your-libido\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boost your sex drive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, getting to the root of the issue will help you better understand your overall health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having challenges with your libido, speak to one of our doctors. You can see a physician in under two minutes from your smartphone, tablet, or computer.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your sex drive is linked to your overall health.
