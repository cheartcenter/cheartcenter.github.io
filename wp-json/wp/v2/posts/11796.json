If you\u2019re having trouble adjusting, know that you\u2019re not alone. At least some of your coworkers are muting the conference call on their end because their toddler is tantruming or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/itsjojosiwa.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JoJo Siwa<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is blaring in the background. Working from home can be hard. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled these tips to help you work from home as effectively as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Set up a proper home office space<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s one thing to answer a couple of emails from bed first thing in the morning, but it\u2019s another to treat your bed like the office. Beds are for sleep and sex, and working in bed can mess with your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep hygiene<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even if you live in a single room, it\u2019s important to have a designated workspace that is separate from your bed. Not only will it be easier to organize your workspace, it will also allow you to \u201cunplug\u201d from work when it\u2019s time to take a break. Some companies are giving their employees a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/03\/12\/coronavirus-shopify-gives-employees-1000-stipend-to-work-from-home.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stipend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to set up a home office, but even if your work isn\u2019t, try and make your new workspace as comfortable as possible. It&#8217;s hard to work from home effectively when you&#8217;re balancing your laptop on your knees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Get dressed<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be tempting to stay in your jammies all day. After all, they\u2019re probably the most comfortable thing you own and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going outside or having company. But no matter how productive you are, staying in your pyjamas all day is a recipe for feeling bad. No one\u2019s suggesting you don a three-piece suit or put on a full face of makeup, but depression and dropping personal hygiene standards often go hand-in-hand. Show yourself some respect by continuing to practise self-care. Brushing your teeth, showering regularly and getting dressed every day are important ways of doing that. Plus, these actions help form a routine, which is important for both sleep and mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Set boundaries<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you\u2019re at home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re available. This is crucial to communicate to your kids and partner, or anyone else you share space with. If you already have a home office (especially one with a door) this\u2019ll be easier. But you can still get the message across even if you don\u2019t. Try posting a sign to indicate that you\u2019re busy and can\u2019t be interrupted right now (think, \u201cshhhh, mom is working\u201d or something similar). Other cues like lighting a candle or playing classical music during work hours can also work. Just make sure you explain the situation to your kids in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Stick to a schedule<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting boundaries isn\u2019t just for your family. Your work should also respect that working from home doesn\u2019t mean working whenever you\u2019re home. Try to start and end your day at the same time as you did before the pandemic. And don&#8217;t forget to take your usual breaks throughout the day. If your workplace has flexible hours, make sure your boss and coworkers are clear when you\u2019re available \u2014 this helps you set limits with them and also keeps you accountable to your schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the structure of a typical workplace, the freedom of working at home can start to feel like free time. For the procrastinators among us, this makes it easier to put tasks off until \u201clater,\u201d only to realize that it\u2019s too late. In terms of getting individual work done, figure out when you\u2019re most productive. Aim to do your most challenging tasks then, and set that time into your schedule every day. That means no answering email, no cleaning the kitchen, and no getting sucked into Facebook. If your most productive period somehow also corresponds to your kid\u2019s neediest one, don\u2019t be afraid to drop them in front of the iPad for a while to get some work done. This is all temporary and some extra screen time right now <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/globalinsight\/stories\/rethinking-screen-time-time-covid-19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">won\u2019t cause lasting damage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Make time for breaks<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to feel like you should be slogging through your work day without stopping. But not making time for breaks can lead to burnout. By all means keep working if you\u2019re \u201cin the zone,\u201d but if you\u2019re going over the same thing again and again, stop and refocus. Taking breaks, especially movement breaks, leaves you refreshed and ready to jump back into your work. Plus, it can be a way to reward yourself for a specific task. A good rule of thumb is that for every hour to 90 minutes you spend sitting and working, you should take a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/executive.mit.edu\/blog\/want-to-be-more-productive-in-2018-take-more-breaks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15 minute break<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get some movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since kindergarten, most of us have had routine and structure as part of our built-in environment without having to think about them. You have to impose structure on yourself to work from home which can feel downright impossible for some. Don\u2019t stress if you&#8217;re not at maximum productivity right away (or if you don\u2019t get there at all). Learning to work from home effectively can take a while, even under the best of circumstances. Remember, everyone is doing the best they can right now, and no one is expecting perfection.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sharing space, creating structure and tuning out distractions can be challenging.
