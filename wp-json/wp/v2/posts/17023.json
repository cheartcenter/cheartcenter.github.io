But unlike mastering the pincer grip or learning to sit up, potty training shouldn\u2019t be associated with a specific age. Anywhere from about 18 months to three years (or more!) is normal for potty training, and boys tend to take longer than girls. And while toilet training can be stressful, with a lot of patience and a good attitude, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Read on for tips on how to make any <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toilet training method easy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (well, easier).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>At what age should a child be fully potty trained?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age isn\u2019t the best way to determine when to potty train. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toilet training age<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can range widely depending on everything from where your kid is developmentally to their gender (girls tend to do it sooner). Given that kindergarten teachers don\u2019t change diapers, however, most kids should be using the toilet by the time they reach age four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daytime and nighttime potty training are two different things though. The bladder can take a long time to mature, so your little one might be ready for underwear at 22 months, but still wearing diapers at night long after that. Some children can\u2019t stay dry overnight until about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/bedwetting#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20many%20months,5%20and%206%20years%20old.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five or six<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and bedwetting until then is totally normal. The exception is if your child suddenly starts wetting the bed after being dry at night for six months or more. In this case, something else might be going on so it\u2019s best to bring the issue to their doctor for further investigation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Signs your child is ready to potty train<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your child has to be able to do certain non-negotiable things before they can begin potty training. For starters, they have to be able to signal their need to go. Whether that\u2019s asking to use the potty in a full sentence or simply making a pssssss sound, if they can\u2019t express it, they won\u2019t be able to do it consistently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up, your child needs to be able to pull down their own pants. Potty training and independence go hand-in-hand. If they can\u2019t deal with their pants it\u2019s going to be difficult for them to succeed at potty training (especially if they\u2019re in daycare). Once they can do those things, some other signals that they\u2019re ready include asking you to change them when they\u2019re wet, going off to a private place to pee or poop in their diaper and staying dry longer. The timing of their BMs is also a big one \u2014 if their poops are happening at the same times every day, it could be a sign they\u2019re ready to take the plunge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Toilet training methods<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are tons of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potty training methods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out there from <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infant potty training<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (yes, it\u2019s a real thing) to the three day method (hint &#8211; it involves covering your house in garbage bags). But whichever <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toilet training method<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you choose, consistency and praise should be central to the process. Potty training is a habit and your child is more likely to stick with it if they feel good about the process. Shaming, yelling and tears will make it miserable for everyone. If you find that potty training is getting out of hand, your child might not be ready (even if they\u2019ve used the potty successfully multiple times). Take the pressure off by putting them back in diapers and try again in a few weeks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Potty training must-haves<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every child is different, but in most cases you\u2019ll likely want to start with a potty because it\u2019s the right height for little feet to rest comfortably on the floor. There\u2019s no need to shell out for one with all the bells and whistles though. Most kids are happy to go in a plain, utilitarian potty. Some kids even prefer a child-sized seat that goes on the big toilet coupled with a stool instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides a potty or child toilet seat, praise has to be part of the equation no matter which potty training method you&#8217;re using. If your child starts telling you that they need to go or that they\u2019ve just gone, encourage this! Praise them for telling you and offer to change them right away. You can also ask if they want to sit on the potty (if they haven\u2019t gone yet). Even if nothing happens, congratulate them just for sitting on it \u2014 this is a BIG step.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hiccups and regressions<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some kids are so ready to potty train they basically do it themselves, while others struggle a little more. If your child seems ready initially and later has a regression, don\u2019t take it personally. It\u2019s not a sign that something is wrong with them. Potty training is a really big deal and kids decide they want to stop for lots of reasons. Some children develop a fear of losing a part of themselves when they poop, while others are afraid of the toilet (that flush is pretty loud!). Many just don\u2019t want to take a break from playing in order to go. If your little one backs off, give them some time and space. Whatever you do, don\u2019t force the issue. Putting too much pressure on your toddler to potty train can cause them to hold in their pee and poop. And not only can you not force them to go to the bathroom, it isn\u2019t good for them physically. Kids who hold in their poop can end up with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/constipation-in-babies-and-infants\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impacted stool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and even fecal incontinence. Giving your little one some extra time will usually make <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potty training easier<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Toilet training tips<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familiarize your toddler with the toilet. Let them push the handle to flush and even watch you pee (if you\u2019re comfortable with that).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage your toddler to sit on the potty at the same time every day. Start with short increments of a minute (or less) and increase the time gradually.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make potty training fun! Read a book or sing some songs on the potty. Time passes pretty slowly when you\u2019re little and sitting for a minute can feel like an hour. Reinforce that potty time is fun.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t force potty training! If your little one freaks out and starts crying at the thought of it, revisit the whole thing in a few weeks. They\u2019re not ready.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a sticker chart, but only once their potty habit is starting to establish. If they\u2019ve gone a few times and you feel like they need an extra push, a sticker chart is a great way to do that. Keep it by the potty and have them add a sticker to it each time they go. But be warned, if your little one is hesitant and you add a chart, they might see it as extra pressure and it could backfire.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be patient! Just because yours is the last kid at nursery school to potty train doesn\u2019t mean something is wrong. Everyone goes at their own pace and they\u2019ll get there eventually. No one walks down the aisle at their wedding in a diaper.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are so many toilet training methods out there it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin.
