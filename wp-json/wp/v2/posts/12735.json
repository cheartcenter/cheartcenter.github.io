But if you find that you\u2019re getting sick over and over, it\u2019s probably more than just bad luck. Here are some of the most common answers to the question \u201cwhy do I keep getting sick?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your immune system is compromised<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an immune system disorder means that your immune system is less able to fight off bacterial and viral infections. Individuals with immune system disorders get sick more often and for longer than those without them. It\u2019s possible to be born with an immune system disorder, but you can also acquire one later in life (like with HIV\/AIDS). Getting sick more often than normal is often one of the signs that clues people into realizing that they have one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while it\u2019s not an immune system disorder, being worn down can also make you more likely to get sick. Being constantly on-the-go, puts your immune system into a state of stress. Chronic stress, poor diet and lack of sleep make you less able to fend off infection. If you\u2019re not making time for R and R, you\u2019re probably going to keep getting sick. Your immune system can\u2019t take care of you if you don\u2019t take care of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You didn\u2019t fully recover from your last illness<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you push yourself too hard before you\u2019ve had a chance to fully recuperate, you\u2019re liable to get sick again, which is why it sometimes seems like you have cold after cold after cold. And you might need longer than you think to get better \u2014 especially as you get older. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to ease yourself back into things gradually when you\u2019re coming off an illness and to follow your doctor\u2019s advice. If you\u2019re prescribed antibiotics, for example, it\u2019s crucial that you finish the entire course, even if you start to feel better. Otherwise, you might not clear the infection completely, making you vulnerable to a resurgence (and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/antibiotic-resistance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antibiotic-resistant bacteria<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your lifestyle is impacting your health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, regular exercise is good for your health \u2014 it\u2019s one of the factors that helps you to boost your immune system. But some research also suggests that a particularly strenuous workout can actually make you more vulnerable to getting sick for a period of time. If you\u2019re constantly pushing beyond your limits in the gym, you could be making yourself more susceptible to illness. But take this one with a grain of salt. Because on balance, an occasional bout of strenuous exercise is better than not exercising at all, especially if it means the difference between being a healthy weight or overweight or obese. We don\u2019t exactly know why, but being overweight <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.obesityaction.org\/community\/article-library\/obesity-and-the-immune-system\/#:~:text=Eating%20healthier%20and%20incorporating%20moderate,decreased%20responsiveness%20to%20some%20vaccinations.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diminishes immune function<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and makes you more susceptible to infections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the most important contribution you can make to improving immune function is to not\u00a0 smoke. Numerous studies show that smokers are sick <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/tobacco\/data_statistics\/sgr\/50th-anniversary\/pdfs\/fs_smoking_overall_health_508.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=65ffd2cc-12ee-4ec3-9fc3-42521436a147\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more often<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than non-smokers, and that they also get <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/32709\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more sick<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than individuals who are not exposed to cigarette smoke. We don\u2019t yet know the precise effects of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/should-you-be-vaping-instead-of-smoking\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vaping vs. smoking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 mainly because vaping hasn\u2019t been around long enough for extensive study \u2014 but health officials are clear that vaping also has negative health consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You have kids<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While adults shouldn\u2019t expect to get more than two to four colds a year, this goes out the window if you have young children. That\u2019s because once kids start daycare, they\u2019re on track for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/article?contentid=12&amp;language=english\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six to 12<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> colds a year. Little kids are notorious for picking their noses, coughing, sneezing and then touching basically every surface ever, so it\u2019s not all that surprising. And if you\u2019re bringing one of these little germ collectors home and snuggling with them, you\u2019ll likely find yourself getting sick more often too. Luckily, this starts to ease up as their immune systems gain exposure to different viruses and their personal hygiene improves. You can also help to guard against this by teaching your child good hand, sneeze, and cough hygiene from an early age. Which brings us to our next point.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You don\u2019t have good hygiene<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because your hands look clean doesn\u2019t mean they are. If the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything it\u2019s that washing your hands is one of the best ways of keeping yourself from getting sick. The average person touches their face more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25637115\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an hour \u2014 often without even realizing it. And each time they do, it\u2019s an opportunity for whatever germs are on your hands to enter your body through your eyes, nose or mouth. If you\u2019re not washing your hands after using the washroom, before eating and as soon as you arrive home from work (or school or wherever else you happen to go), you\u2019re providing an opportunity for germs to spread. The science in this case is simple: up your hand-washing game to boost your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few reasons why you might be continuously sick. It could be as easy to solve as washing your hands more often or just a matter of waiting for your toddler to grow up a little. Take some time to examine your lifestyle for clues, but if you find that you\u2019re constantly getting sick and there\u2019s no reason you can suss out, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak with a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It could also be a signal that something else is going on with your body.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From being a parent to an undiagnosed health issue, if
