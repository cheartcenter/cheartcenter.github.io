And if you were struggling with mental health challenges before the pandemic, isolation has made it difficult or impossible to access your usual supports. But in times of adversity <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and stress, self-care<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more important than ever. Here&#8217;s a list of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-care strategies to reduce stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while social distancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Socialize<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re only supposed to go out for essentials, you can stay in and still be social. That\u2019s why many people are beginning to use the term \u201cphysical distancing\u201d instead. FaceTime, Zoom, Houseparty and other platforms let you see your nearest and dearest, while still keeping your distance. Make a date to have a coffee with a friend or organize a family dinner, virtually. Or try an old-fashioned telephone call. Even texts and group chats can help you feel more connected. Humans are hard-wired to be social, and maintaining our connections to each other is even more important in times like these.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-care strategies for stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of self-care for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> maintaining <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health and managing stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can\u2019t be overstated. We\u2019ve all heard of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, and how human beings are designed to cope with short bursts of stress. What we aren\u2019t designed to cope with is chronic stress, which is what the current pandemic is causing. Chronic stress is no joke, so it\u2019s important to give our bodies and minds a break from all the tension we\u2019re feeling. If you saw a therapist in person before COVID-19, see if you\u2019re able to continue your sessions online. Most people are working from home, and mental health professionals are no exception. If you\u2019re not able to continue sessions with your usual therapist, other <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online therapy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> resources are available.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to mental health and relaxation tools you can use on your own at home, there are a number of options. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.anxietycanada.com\/sites\/default\/files\/MuscleRelaxation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progressive muscle relaxation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, mindfulness, meditation, yoga and breathing exercises are all quick, easy to access, and effective. Best of all, you don\u2019t have to be a zen master to practice any of these.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A quick google search, a couple of minutes, and a quiet space are all you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Take care of your body<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress affects the immune system, and can wear you down over time. Getting enough sleep and eating as well as you can are important ways of practicing self-care while social distancing. Plus, they can help to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/protect-yourself-from-coronavirus-by-boosting-your-immune-system\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boost your immune system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Try to maintain your pre-pandemic daily routine, and prioritize proper nutrition. While so-called \u201ccomfort foods\u201d are indeed comforting, they tend to be higher in sugar and starch. That causes a momentary spike in blood sugar, followed by a crash that can actually cause you to feel worse in the long run. Sweets are fine to eat on occasion, but try not to stress eat cookies on the daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The benefits of self-care<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best things you can do for self-care is to get some exercise. That\u2019s because exercise isn\u2019t just good for you physically \u2014 it\u2019s been shown to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1470658\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce anxiety<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, negative mood and even depression. While you obviously can\u2019t hit the gym right now, you still have options. A number of personal trainers, yoga instructors, and other fitness gurus have moved their operations online. It\u2019s not hard to find reasonable and even free online workout sessions right now, regardless of what you\u2019re into. Instagram and youtube are also great resources. If all else fails, jumping jacks and push up are some great options for a quick, mood boosting interlude.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lower your expectations<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/how-to-protect-your-familys-mental-health-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\">talked about this before<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but this one bears repeating. Just because other people are learning Swahili right now, doesn\u2019t mean you have to. We\u2019re all coping with an increased mental load, and everyone copes in their own way. Taking this situation day-by-day and simply getting through it is enough at the moment. Placing unreasonable expectations on yourself doesn\u2019t help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard not to feel like the days are all running together right now. Self-care can help to inject some self-discipline into your day to help keep away overwhelming emotions. Everyone is experiencing challenges at the moment, regardless of their situation. Learning <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to take care of stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can take some practice. Practicing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-care while social distancing helps to ease the stress and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fear that isolation and uncertainty cause. Be kind to yourself and remember that this too shall pass.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Isolation affects mental health and makes it harder to access supports.
