They\u2019re so tiny and helpless that getting them slippery in the bathtub is mildly terrifying for a new parent. With any luck, your labour and delivery nurse or your midwife can walk you through your baby\u2019s first bath. But if you\u2019re here, that probably hasn\u2019t happened (or you\u2019re looking for a refresher). Here\u2019s our step-by-step guide to bathing a newborn baby. Just make sure you read it ahead of time \u2014 you\u2019ll need both hands for what you\u2019re about to do!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do I need a baby bathtub?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A basin or a baby bathtub is nice to have, but not necessary. Most kitchen sinks are perfect swap-ins, as long as they\u2019re clean and thoroughly rinsed of cleanser. But you can also bathe your baby in your usual tub as long as you can hold on to them comfortably \u2014 you might have to get into the bath yourself if yours is super deep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When and how often should I bathe my newborn?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should first bathe a newborn when<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they\u2019re a day or two old. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to bathe a newborn baby with an umbilical cord<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to mean giving your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sponge bath<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But sponge baths increase the risk of heat loss. Most doctors now agree that you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/trilliumhealthpartners.ca\/patientservices\/womens\/Pages\/Caring-for-your-baby-and-yourself.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safely tub bathe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your baby before they lose their umbilical cord \u2014 just make sure to gently pat their cord area dry before dressing them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might work for you, bathing your newborn every day can dry out their skin. As long as you clean your baby\u2019s diaper area thoroughly at each change, you don\u2019t need to bathe them more than a couple of times a week. And here\u2019s a hot tip \u2014 if your baby still has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2763724\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vernix<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on them, there\u2019s no need to wash it off. You can gently rub the vernix into your baby\u2019s skin \u2014 it\u2019ll increase its softness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A step-by-step guide to bathing your newborn<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">temperature<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn\u2019s bath<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> right is probably the hardest part of the whole process. Newborns get cold easily, so it should be warm. Make it too hot, however, and you risk burning them. To figure out the right temperature, dip the underside of your wrist into the water \u2014 it should feel warm, but not hot. But the water temperature isn\u2019t the only thing that should be inviting. You\u2019ll want to make sure that the air temperature of the bathroom is comfortable for your baby too. If it\u2019s on the chilly side, run a hot shower for a few minutes before filling the tub to heat up the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve checked the water temperature, place the baby in the tub, in about two inches of water. Support their head and neck to keep their ears and face above water and run a clean washcloth under warm water. Use one corner of the washcloth to wipe outward over one eyelid, beginning in the inner corner of your baby\u2019s eye. Use a different corner of the washcloth to do the same to the other eye. Gently wipe the rest of the baby&#8217;s face and the folds of their neck with the cloth. Then move on to their hair, body, hands and feet. You <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can use bath products on a baby whenever<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re ready to bathe them in a tub as long as they&#8217;re gentle and perfume-free. Most importantly, always keep one hand on your baby at all times and never leave them unattended in the bathtub, even for a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to bathe a baby boy vs. girl<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For boys, you\u2019ll need to clean both their scrotum and penis. If the boy is newly-circumcised, soap will sting the circumcision wound, so best to use only water until it\u2019s healed. If the boy is uncircumcised, you can use non-irritating soap and water, but there\u2019s no need to pull back his foreskin. This typically doesn\u2019t retract until a boy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw142263spec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turns five<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 or later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For baby girls, warm water and non-irritating soap are sufficient for cleaning the genitals. There&#8217;s no need to clean inside the vagina as it is self cleaning. And always make sure you clean (and wipe) baby girls front to back, to avoid bringing bacteria into the vagina.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What to do if baby hates the bath<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your baby freaks out the minute they\u2019re in the bath, try getting into the tub with them. Bathing together can be a nice time for doing skin-to-skin and both parents can take turns. You can even nurse in the bath (though this might mean cleaning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/a-parents-guide-to-baby-poop\/\">baby poop<\/a> out of the bath).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that your baby loves her bath and cries when you take her out of it, it might be because she\u2019s cold. If you\u2019re wrapping her up in a tiny, thin baby towel, try a large, fluffy adult one instead. And if that still doesn\u2019t work, throw one in the dryer ahead of time so it\u2019s still warm when her bath finishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first bath you give your newborn can be stressful, but it\u2019ll quickly become routine. Ask your partner, a family member or friend to help, but know that as long as you never leave your newborn unattended (even for a second) and make sure they stay warm, it\u2019ll be a success. You might even find that it becomes one of your favourite activities to do together.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bathing a newborn can be intimidating, but as long as
