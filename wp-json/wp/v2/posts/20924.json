Until recently, conventional wisdom dictated that losing weight meant limiting the amount of fat in your diet. Then the keto diet exploded into popular culture, and turned that idea on its head. But is the keto diet really as effective as enthusiasts make it out to be? And is there anyone who shouldn\u2019t follow it? Here\u2019s everything you need to know if you\u2019re considering going keto.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is the keto diet?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem like a new fad, the keto diet has actually been around for 100 years. The keto diet was first used in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19049574\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1920s to treat epilepsy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before the discovery of anti-seizure medication, and is still used as an adjunct treatment in some juvenile patients with seizures today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keto diet involves restricting your carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day. For reference, that\u2019s about the amount in four slices of bread. Instead of getting your calories from carbohydrates, you\u2019re supposed to sub in fats and fibrous vegetables. To be considered truly \u201cketo\u201d, you\u2019re supposed to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/healthy-weight\/diet-reviews\/ketogenic-diet\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintain a ratio of 70 &#8211; 80% fat<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 5-10% carbs, and 10-20% protein.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does the keto diet work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you give it the chance, your body will use carbohydrates to power itself. That\u2019s because carbs turn into glucose, which is the preferred source of energy for most of the body\u2019s cells \u2014 if it\u2019s available. When your body doesn\u2019t have enough glucose floating around, it switches to breaking down fat molecules instead. These fat molecules turn into ketone bodies, which your cells can also use as a source of energy. This alternative form of powering yourself is called going into ketosis \u2014 hence the keto diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What can I eat on the keto diet?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the ratio of fat to carbohydrates is so high on keto, you\u2019re limited when it comes to many staples of the typical western diet \u2014 think no bread, rice, potatoes, or pasta. While this is obvious, keto newbies are sometimes surprised to learn that higher-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables like apples, pears, and carrots are also off the table. There\u2019s room to eat some fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries, provided you don\u2019t go overboard. However,\u00a0 meat, eggs, fish, nuts, cheese, seeds, and green, fibrous, vegetables are the main building blocks of the diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is the keto diet actually healthy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One concern with the keto diet is the rise in LDL cholesterol that\u2019s associated with an increased fat intake, including saturated fats. Another concern with this diet is that it\u2019s difficult to stick to. With just about everything starchy off the table, it\u2019s easy to wonder what\u2019s actually left to eat. Some keto dieters find themselves resorting to processed and packaged keto foods \u2014 which often contain additives and unhealthy amounts of salt \u2014\u00a0 as a way of replacing diet staples like crackers and bread. For those who add the high-fat components of the diet but don\u2019t stick to the low carb part of it, their keto-adjacent diet is a recipe for increased weight gain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond making mealtimes more difficult, cutting out carbs becomes unhealthy if you go about it the wrong way. Apples, carrots, and bananas are some of the most accessible fruits and vegetables for people, but they\u2019re also significant sources of carbohydrates. Cutting out fruits and vegetables like these without replacing them with low-carb ones can result in a nutritionally-deficient diet. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dietitian\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing a dietician<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help if you find yourself struggling with what to eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who should go keto?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that reducing your carbohydrate intake is good for both weight loss and lowering blood sugar levels. This means that the keto diet can be useful for both controlling your weight and managing pre-diabetes. Because the diet helps to control the amount of glucose in your blood, some doctors recommend it as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2716748\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment for obesity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and as a way of managing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the keto diet itself isn\u2019t inherently unhealthy or dangerous, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, it&#8217;s important to consult with your doctor before beginning any new dietary regime. High-protein diets exacerbate conditions like kidney disease, for example, so going keto is potentially risky \u2014 especially if you swap your usual carbs for meat. Keto can also heighten your risk of developing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17621514\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kidney stones<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As well, if you take medications, know that changes in your nutrition can potentially affect your body\u2019s reactions to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keto diet has the potential to be a great tool for weight loss, and as a way to manage blood sugar. But it\u2019s not all about eating bacon-wrapped cheese. Replacing carbohydrates with protein and fat is only good up to a point \u2014 without incorporating the proper amount of vegetables and fruits, you risk losing out on the fiber and vitamins you need to keep yourself healthy. If you\u2019re considering going keto, speaking to a nutritionist can help you to avoid some of the most common keto pitfalls.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Low-fat diets don\u2019t get rid of fat.
