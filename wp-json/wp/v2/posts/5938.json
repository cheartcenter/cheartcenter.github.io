The trouble is, many oncologists in Canada are overloaded. They often don\u2019t have the time to answer all your questions and give you peace of mind. Cancer care can also vary from one hospital to another. This means that some of your concerns may go unanswered. Or you may not hear about cutting edge research and trials that may help. Your oncologist is there to put together a treatment plan, explain the treatments they can offer, and help you navigate the system. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you want to fully understand your illness, and be aware of all treatment options <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including those outside Canada <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you may want to\u00a0get a second opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Finding the best treatment plan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer treatments are constantly evolving, and new experimental trials pop up almost weekly. Because so<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-type\/breast\/treatment\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> many factors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can affect cancer treatment, and because there are so many options, two doctors might take completely\u00a0different treatment approaches to the same cancer. It\u2019s no wonder your treatment options can feel overwhelming \u2014 and you may not even feel comfortable with any of them. Getting a second opinion, especially if it\u2019s from an oncologist who specializes in your particular cancer, can help you feel that you\u2019ve tapped into as many different knowledge sources as necessary and ensure that you\u2019re comfortable with your treatment plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Be your own advocate<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocating for yourself (or for a family member) is sometimes the only way to find a treatment plan you\u2019re comfortable with. Even though your oncologist knows a great deal about cancer and how to treat it, they don\u2019t always know you. It\u2019s important to work with them, to help them understand what treatments you would be comfortable with and what you are unwilling to do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, though, it might feel like your doctor doesn\u2019t have the time to listen to you, or that they don\u2019t have all the information you\u2019re looking for. Knowing when to be your own advocate can help save your life \u2014 or just give you the reassurance that your medical team is on the right track.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should I get a second opinion on cancer?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing when to seek a second opinion about a medical treatment can be tricky. Because we have instant access to health information online, we\u2019re all guilty of doing our own medical research (even if we don\u2019t like to admit it!). And because online information is often inaccurate or not appropriate for you, it can be scary. Especially if Dr. Google is saying something different from your oncologist. Luckily there are some rules of thumb to help guide you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one thing, if you\u2019ve already gone through treatment and it hasn\u2019t worked, that can be a sign that it may be time to get a second opinion. If you feel as though you\u2019re not being presented with a full range of treatment options,\u00a0it might be good to talk to a second oncologist. And if you feel like your doctor is too busy to listen to your concerns, it could also mean it\u2019s worth seeking out\u00a0another opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to keep in mind that cancer is really a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-101\/what-is-cancer\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> collection of different diseases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it\u2019s impossible for oncologists to be a specialist in each subtype of cancer out there. This can be especially true when dealing with a rare form of cancer. So if your assigned oncologist isn\u2019t an expert in your particular disease, getting a second opinion just makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to get a second opinion for cancer treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a second opinion on a cancer diagnosis isn\u2019t as complex as you may think. The Canadian Medical Association explicitly states in its<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/policybase.cma.ca\/documents\/policypdf\/PD04-06.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> code of ethics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a doctor needs to \u201cRespect your patient&#8217;s reasonable request for a second opinion from a physician of the patient&#8217;s choice.\u201d So there\u2019s no need to worry that your doctor will be mad or insulted. That said, it\u2019s a good idea to tell <span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701329248_898778801850544\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span>your doctor you&#8217;ll be seeking another opinion, just so they&#8217;re not blindsided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a second opinion might be as simple as asking your current oncologist for a referral. If just the thought of that makes you uncomfortable, or they don\u2019t know where to refer you, there are other options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Second opinion oncology service<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer is scary; feeling like you may not be getting the best treatment plan can make that fear even worse. We understand that fear, so we\u2019ve launched an oncology second opinion specialty service. It helps patients understand their diagnoses, informs them of the latest research, and can help create treatment plans that patients can then take to their own physicians. Your intake assessment is just $25. If our oncology team agrees with yours, you can move on with your original treatment plan with peace of mind.\u00a0<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571700946096_9029495629118152\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to\u00a0move forward with<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125104_9663965240853634\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125110_21339281556770962\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125113_2777359659719325\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125117_17808514684113752\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125119_3786122394538871\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1571701125122_8526026242469869\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span> a follow-up consultation, you\u2019ll be able to book an oncology team member for an hour to review your case\u00a0in detail.
