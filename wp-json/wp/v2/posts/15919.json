Without competitive healthcare benefits, it\u2019s hard to create a winning workplace where talent can flourish. After all, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.willistowerswatson.com\/en-US\/insights\/2018\/08\/employee-and-employer-satisfaction-with-group-benefit-marketplaces-survey-results\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">78% of employees report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that they\u2019re more likely to stick around for the long haul if their employers offer comprehensive health benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a strong workplace culture starts with investing in the health of your employees. This includes telemedicine, or \u201cvirtual care\u201d coverage. With social distancing mandates in effect, it\u2019s crucial that your employees receive the care they need while minimizing their exposure to others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this is only one of the many benefits that come with investing in t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">elemedicine benefits for your employees<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We\u2019ve listed some of the other top reasons to offer virtual care below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthening company culture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health and wellness are at the heart of thriving workplace cultures. When your employees feel safe, healthy, and supported, they perform better at work. On average, employees who have comprehensive health benefits, including virtual care, are <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/benefits\/documents\/resources-whitepapers-health-and-well-being.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11% more engaged<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at work than those who don\u2019t.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring safety and social distancing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the arrival of COVID-19, virtual care is changing the way primary care is delivered. Maintaining distance is a critical factor for providing safe and effective healthcare services in this \u201cnew normal.\u201d Virtual care also reduces the strain of patient demand on healthcare facilities and limits potential infection exposure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually doctor\u2019s offices are thought of as safe places. Today, many patients feel apprehensive about visiting a doctor in-person for care not related to COVID-19. Fortunately, virtual care lets patients receive the care they need from the comfort of their homes without jeopardizing their safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accessible mental healthcare<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One in every five<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadian adults will experience a mental health or substance abuse problem in any given year.

Patients can speak with therapists via text or video to receive the therapy they need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support a remote workforce<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular. Recent reports show that many Canadians are now working remotely from cottages and rural locations more than ever. For some remote employees, seeing a physician means driving hours to the nearest town. Thanks to virtual care, those working from remote locations can access the care they need even if local options are scarce.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee absenteeism with telemedicine<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Canada, employee absenteeism <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sunlife.ca\/static\/canada\/Sponsor\/About%20Group%20Benefits\/Focus%20Update\/2013\/Special%20Edition%20-%20Sept.%2023%20-%20%20Sun%20Life%20co-sponsors%20major%20new%20Conference%20Board%20of\/MissinginAction_SUN%20LIFE_EN.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs over $16 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annually. This loss translates, on average, to nine days of forfeited productivity per employee. A typical Canadian company will lose over $2,000 per employee every year to employee absences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s often not possible to schedule a same-day doctor\u2019s appointment in person. Since up to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/articles\/2012\/07\/24\/pros-and-cons-of-telemedicine-for-todays-workers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of doctor visits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be handled remotely, telemedicine lets employees quickly address their health issues without taking time off work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase your business\u2019s competitiveness<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s proven that fully-trained employees are more productive and bring greater monetary value than newer employees. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telemedicine has employee retention benefits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, since the majority of workers state that health benefits are a major factor when it comes to job satisfaction. For the most in-demand candidates, they can afford to be even choosier. Offering virtual care<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a competitive advantage for employers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looking to put together teams that contain the best available talent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Empower a productive workforce<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business is only as healthy as its employees. When your team has better access to care, studies show that teams enjoy a healthy boost in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">productivity from workplace telemedicine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Lost productivity due to suboptimal health costs over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3128441\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$260 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annually. Recently, a study found that teams with one worker suffering depression are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/316753097_Mental_Health_and_Productivity_at_Work_Does_What_You_Do_Matter\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5% less productive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a whole than healthy teams. A five percent difference in productivity can make a world of difference for a company\u2019s bottom line. If you want to boost <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">workplace performance, telemedicine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great place to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy employees can focus on their jobs instead of worrying about managing symptoms they\u2019re dealing with. Virtual care lets employees see a physician faster and with fewer barriers, so employees can get back to their jobs quicker and feel better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boost work-life balance and employee satisfaction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual care cuts out the time spent transiting to and from a doctor\u2019s office, and prescriptions can be delivered right to patients\u2019 doorsteps. Employees with virtual care coverage can optimize their schedules to visit a doctor when it\u2019s convenient for them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual care also boosts work-life balance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by freeing up time for employees to take care of more rewarding tasks. Taking the dog for a walk, one-on-one time with kids, or a rejuvenating meditation session are more fulfilling uses of time than sitting in a waiting room.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a happier, healthier team. A recent Ipsos poll <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifehealthpro.ca\/news\/virtual-care-vital-to-employee-satisfaction-rbc-insurance-325268.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found that 72% of Canadians<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would view their employer more positively if they were offered telemedicine benefits. This is especially true of young employees aged 18 to 34 years old, who rank lowest in job satisfaction and mental health. Among this demographic, 78% say they would view their employer more positively if given telemedicine benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be a workplace innovator, invest in telemedicine<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exceptional times we\u2019re living in have underscored the need for telemedicine. Social distance mandates have made virtual care imperative for businesses that want to protect the health and safety of their employees. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual care benefits both employers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and employees, as well as our broader communities as we work to finally quell COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, studies show employee satisfaction is highest in companies that prioritize the health, well-being, and freedom of their workers. Telemedicine does just that by providing employees with fast, effective care on their own terms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for ways to support the health of your workforce?
