You\u2019re forming new friendships, learning new things, and working towards a big goal. Plus, for lots of students, college or university is the first time you\u2019re living on your own without family. Even though those experiences are great, managing so many new things at once can feel overwhelming. It\u2019s little wonder that so many <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students in university and college experience stress.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in college and university are developing depression at startlingly high rates.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/ontariosuniversities.ca\/issues-priorities\/student-supports\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, 75% of mental health challenges first appear before you turn 25<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warning signs of depression in college and university students<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Depression is often episodic, meaning not everyone with depression has it for the rest of their life.\u00a0 With the right support, it\u2019s possible to manage <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">school work<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while making strides against depression. The first step is learning the causes and symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Causes of depression in college and university students<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of new stressors in college and university that can build up and make you feel overwhelmed. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adaa.org\/learn-from-us\/from-the-experts\/blog-posts\/consumer\/depression-among-college-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression and anxiety in college students<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are unfortunately both very common<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2016, 46% of post-secondary students in one survey <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ontariosuniversities.ca\/issues-priorities\/student-supports\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported feeling too depressed to function.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This could look different for everyone. Some students withdraw from friends and social activities. Others don\u2019t have the mental clarity to focus on schoolwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freshman year,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/manitoba\/university-loneliness-back-to-school-1.3753653\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is especially common.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s because you\u2019re getting into a new routine that has altered sleep, eating, and exercise rhythms. Those three things are essential for the maintenance of good mental health. So, when those routines are unbalanced it can increase <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emotional problems in university and college students<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may not feel stressed out by the same things as other students you know. Everyone is different. If you\u2019re feeling down, here are a few common causes for depression that might be contributing:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic pressure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The link between <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression and grades<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is straightforward. The more you worry about doing well in school, the more stress builds up. It\u2019s great to be motivated to succeed, but it\u2019s equally important to be kind to yourself. If you\u2019re dedicated to your studies, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failing classes because of depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the last thing you want. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4443903\/#:~:text=Results%20showed%20that%20mental%20health,did%20not%20improve%20or%20worsened.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritizing your mental health can actually get you closer to your goals, rather than putting too much pressure on yourself.<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money worries<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/news.osu.edu\/70-percent-of-college-students-stressed-about-finances\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of college students are stressed about their finances<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Tuition fees and textbooks are expensive. Plus, you might be managing money on your own for the first time. Learning to properly manage money is a lifelong journey, so it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not doing it perfectly from the start. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneysense.ca\/save\/6-money-saving-tips-for-post-secondary-students\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips to help students become at ease with their finances.<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drugs and alcohol<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So much of the post-secondary experience is about socializing. You might find yourself in a location where alcohol is being served. Managing your intake of alcohol is important, especially if you\u2019re having mental health troubles. <a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/t1\/tbl1\/en\/tv.action?pid=1310009611\">Millions of university-aged Canadians report heavy drinking.<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Alcohol and drug use can contribute to low mood. With all the other pressures of school, it\u2019s understandable that substance misuse could lead to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression in college and university students.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Symptoms of depression in university and college students<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being depressed isn\u2019t the same as regular sadness. When you\u2019re depressed, you feel deeply sad every day for two weeks or more. Another typical symptom is losing interest in things that usually excite you or make you happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you tell if you\u2019re experiencing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression at university?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Here\u2019s what to look for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling sad or close to tears.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling hopeless.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No interest in doing things you usually like.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loss of appetite.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling guilty for no clear reason.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight loss.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling irritable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trouble controlling emotions, emotional outbursts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding it hard to think clearly or remember things.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep problems, like sleeping too much or too little.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling restless or anxious.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unexplained aches or pains.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking about death or suicide.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression after college or university<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People often feel anxious or depressed even after their post-secondary days are over. If you were having trouble with your mental health in college, be sure to continue monitoring your health after graduation. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/health-science\/theres-such-a-thing-as-post-graduation-depression-i-know-i-had-it\/2017\/08\/04\/4d163c6a-618d-11e7-a4f7-af34fc1d9d39_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post college depression symptoms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the same as the ones above. But this time, the depression may be brought on by leaving behind friends and routines you built during school. Just like at the start of college, the transition to your new life after graduation is tough for some people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Getting the help you need<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">college and university freshmen, depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is common. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a serious illness. If you\u2019re depressed, therapy can help lift your mood and turn around negative thought patterns. Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">withdrawing from school due to depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find support. It\u2019s important to build strong habits that boost your mental health from the start of your college adventure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can start by talking to people you trust like family and friends. Every campus has mental health resources, too.
