Researchers worldwide have been working around the clock to develop a vaccine, while everyday socializing \u2014 from work to parties \u2014 now happens online. Whether you\u2019re tinkering in a lab or flattening the curve by staying at home, the ending to this chapter in history is still a mystery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this isn\u2019t the first time a pandemic has swept through continents. In 1918, the Spanish flu infected millions of people. More recently, the SARS outbreak from 2002-2004 gave us modern pandemic learnings to draw from. What we know from the past gives us clues to how COVID-19 might end.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What exactly is a pandemic?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we consider how the pandemic will end, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s unique about the situation we find ourselves in with COVID-19. The World Health Organization has outlined a few key factors that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/bulletin\/volumes\/89\/7\/11-088815\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">define a pandemic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from other patterns of infectious disease:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. The disease spreads out of season<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fall, students returning to school will often spread the seasonal flu within a community. This isn\u2019t cause for alarm, but with a few additional characteristics, a virus can turn from a nuisance to a danger. COVID-19 cases were reported all over the world, even in countries where it wasn\u2019t a normal time of year for flu to spread. When this happens, it\u2019s a clue that the disease has unusual traits. Diseases that are unusual are a cause for concern because it\u2019s unknown how fast they\u2019ll spread, or how severe they\u2019ll be.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. It spreads in multiple hemispheres at one time<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name suggests, a \u201cpan\u201d-demic is a health emergency that affects people all around the world. From Wuhan, China to cities in Australia, Africa, and beyond, the virus made its way between global hemispheres in a matter of weeks. The rapid spread around the world is uncharacteristic of a common flu, so it rightfully caused international alarm.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a new disease<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/disease\/swineflu\/frequently_asked_questions\/pandemic\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">important factor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because when a virus is new, no one has built up an immunity to it. That leads to higher infection rates since your body doesn\u2019t have any antibodies to battle the virus. It also means there&#8217;s no vaccine, and protecting people from infection until a vaccine is developed is difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How might this story end?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few likely scenarios for how the pandemic will end. Some of them are rooted in scientific breakthroughs, some depend on our biology, and others hinge on our social habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientists create a vaccine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a vaccine, it\u2019s possible to immunize people who haven\u2019t been infected with coronavirus. Immunization is an ancient practice that involves introducing a small amount of a virus into a healthy person\u2019s body. This controlled introduction gives the body a chance to build up antibodies. Antibodies are your body\u2019s defense against pathogens. Once they develop, your body is more effective at fighting and beating the illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outbreaks in communities are quickly contained<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This takes the virus from pandemic to epidemic, meaning it\u2019s contained within one region. Containment is an essential part of stopping the spread \u2014 it\u2019s the reason we quarantine people with COVID-19. It\u2019s simpler to find out where an outbreak began when the virus has only spread through one community. Quick containment of outbreaks will significantly reduce new infections, and decrease the number of cases overall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measures like social distancing, hand washing, and face masks are also helpful for slowing down virus spread. By being mindful of how the virus is transmitted, collective caution helps to reduce infections on a larger scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communities develop herd immunity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herd immunity would happen when a large enough number of people have caught and recovered from COVID-19. This could occur through outbreaks, or in a controlled way through vaccinations. When a certain number of people in a group are immune to a disease, big outbreaks stop happening. From there, the virus can be stopped as long as future generations continue getting vaccinated. For example, before there was a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/about\/history.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">measles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vaccine, the virus infected thousands of people per year. Now that there&#8217;s a vaccine, it\u2019s very uncommon to get measles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it\u2019s theoretically possible to develop herd immunity to COVID-19 without a vaccine, that ending would be tragic. Outbreaks would cause large-scale illness and death before we see a decline in new infections.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will take a combination of social efforts and scientific breakthroughs to end COVID-19. Unfortunately, the exact timeline for returning to normal life is still unknown. Collective efforts to flatten the curve has given us some headway, so until we know more, stick with the pandemic safety habits you\u2019ve formed in 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have questions about your health or need a prescription, but don\u2019t want to go to an in person clinic, our online doctors can help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After so many months of COVID-19, it&#8217;s natural to wonder how this chapter will end.
