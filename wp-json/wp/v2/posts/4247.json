Many of us don\u2019t realize the contributions that psychologists have made, and the ways in which their research touches our daily lives. Psychologists work in just about every industry \u2014 from sports, to schools, to the criminal justice system. We might not notice them, but psychologists shape the way we relate to one another every day.<\/p>\n<h3>What do psychologists do?<\/h3>\n<p>Many think that\u00a0the only time you need a psychologist is if you are having a mental health challenge. And while clinical psychology is a large discipline within the field, psychologists do much more than mental health counselling.<\/p>\n<p>Psychologists use evidence-based research to study human behaviour \u2014 essentially\u00a0why we do the things we do. They work in many different fields, everything from geriatrics to urban planning. Some even work in advertising, helping to design marketing campaigns based on their knowledge of how to influence human behaviour.<\/p>\n<h3>Psychology versus psychiatry<\/h3>\n<p>People often confuse psychologists with psychiatrists, and while both may work in the mental health field, there are notable differences. A psychiatrist is a doctor, which means they hold a doctor of medicine (an M.D.). This means that\u00a0they are certified to prescribe medications, such as antidepressants, to their clients. A psychologist, on the other hand, has a university degree, typically a PhD in psychology, and cannot prescribe medication in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to mental health issues, a psychologist will most likely try to support their client by looking at a broad range of behaviour. They&#8217;ll also examine past\u00a0history and current relationships. A psychiatrist, in contrast, typically views mental health issues as rooted in a chemical imbalance. Because of this, they focus on providing medications such as antidepressants to help. In Canada, psychologists\u00a0do most of the \u201ctalk therapy,\u201d though they often work in tandem with a psychiatrist should the patient need medication.<\/p>\n<p>Provincial healthcare covers seeing a psychiatrist, but requires a referral from your doctor. While you don\u2019t need a referral to see a psychologist, visits are not usually covered, unless through private insurance or extended benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>How does psychology shape our lives?<\/h3>\n<p>Because psychologists study human behaviour, their research is instrumental in shaping how we live. Among many examples, here are a few that stand out.<\/p>\n<h3>Attachment theory<\/h3>\n<p>It might seem crazy now, but we weren\u2019t always aware of how important it is for a baby to be securely bonded with at least one caregiver. Psychologist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/mary-ainsworth.html\">Mary Ainsworth<\/a> observed that babies who bond securely to a caregiver are more confident and eager to learn. We now know how important touching, hugging, and responding to the needs of our babies is because of psychologists.<\/p>\n<h3>Job screening<\/h3>\n<p>Psychology also helps us to make better decisions when it comes to interviewing prospective job candidates. Psychological research shows us\u00a0that interviewers have unconscious bias in a number of ways. You might think you\u2019re making the best choice, but someone\u2019s weight, appearance or even name can influence you without you even knowing it! Because of psychology, we know that having structured interview questions and scoring guidelines for answers, helps employers to rank candidates more equitably. Structured interviews are also <a href=\"https:\/\/cpa.ca\/docs\/File\/Publications\/FactSheets\/PsychologyWorksFactSheet_JobInterview.pdf\">better at predicting<\/a> which candidates will be most successful on the job.<\/p>\n<h3>Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing is a field that has benefited immensely from the field of psychology. Advertising is about influencing consumers to buy your product. So who better to design a marketing campaign than a student of human behaviour? Why are you shown a 12 step list of instructions when you go to erase your profile from certain sites? Because psychology tells us that\u00a0you\u2019re more likely to give up and keep your profile than if you\u2019re shown a two-step process. There is even an entire field devoted to \u201ccolour psychology,\u201d which studies the emotions that different colours elicit in us. Go ahead and google the logos of your favourite fast food chains. Chances are they\u2019re using reds, oranges, and yellows \u2014 the colours psychologists say we associate with appetite, happiness and comfort\u2014\u00a0to subtly influence your meal decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Psychologists want to know why we behave the way we do. Because of this, their input can be valuable in shaping our behaviour to help us\u00a0in many ways. From changing the way we raise our children, to getting us to exercise more, to having happier marriages, the work of psychologists is all around us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psychological research has changed our society so much that it is responsible for many of the things we do on a regular basis.
