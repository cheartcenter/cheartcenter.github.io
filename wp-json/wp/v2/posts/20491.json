You know, the one that runs through your to-do list or practices conversations you\u2019re never going to have with your ex. But not everyone\u2019s inner monologue takes place inside their heads. We all know someone whose self-talk isn\u2019t so internal \u2014 someone who talks to themselves. It may seem odd, but is talking to yourself a sign of anything serious or a sign of genius?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Kids know it\u2019s ok to talk to themselves<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out that talking to yourself is innate. During the toddler stage, children begin to use language as a way to self-regulate. They stop getting so frustrated once they\u2019re able to express themselves functionally. They also use self-talk to cement concepts and direct their own behaviours. This is why toddlers narrate their behaviour, often issuing commands and reminders to themselves \u2014 \u201crun,\u201d \u201cdance,\u201d \u201chot.\u201d This stage is temporary, however, and most kids switch to internal self-talk by about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/scholarworks.uni.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=2239&amp;context=grp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven or eight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-talk helps us learn better<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems like toddlers might be onto something. In a small <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0001691811001867\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, researchers asked one group of participants to read instructions out loud and another to read them in their heads. Just like those toddlers, the group reading the instructions aloud ended up with a better grasp of the material. In other words, participants who talk themselves through tasks do<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> better <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than those who only read instructions silently. So the next time you\u2019re struggling through an instruction manual, try reading it out loud to yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-talk helps you up your game<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our minds are pretty hard to control. Try <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thinking about something and you\u2019re sure to have nothing else in your mind. It\u2019s like the infamous example, \u201cDon\u2019t think about a pink elephant.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance a pink elephant has just entered your thoughts. Focus your attention on something specific, however, like an enjoyable book or riveting TV show and you\u2019re usually able to shut out everything else. Self-talk can serve this function by giving your mind a way to focus on a specific task. Studies with children bear this out. Both well-regulated kids and those who struggle more with behaviour issues <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S088520060700004X\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perform better<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when using self-talk to work through their tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional athletes know this too. There\u2019s no shortage of competitors talking \u2014 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2018\/09\/10\/the-science-of-the-tennis-grunt\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or grunting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 to themselves during competition. In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/oxfordre.com\/psychology\/view\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190236557.001.0001\/acrefore-9780190236557-e-157\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">positive self-talk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a key component of sports psychology. And no one thinks it\u2019s crazy when NFL players do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Talking to yourself improves visual processing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking to yourself isn\u2019t just advantageous when you\u2019re trying to focus your attention or upgrade your golf swing. It turns out that self-talk might help to improve your visual processing too. One <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1080\/17470218.2011.647039\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that participants looking for objects were more likely to find them when they talked to themselves. So the next time you misplace your cell phone, try talking yourself through the process of finding it. You might boost your chances of success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Does talking to yourself correlate with mental illness?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if talking to yourself is ok and actually advantageous, why aren\u2019t more of us doing it regularly? Well, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not socially acceptable \u2014 consider the stereotype of a mentally ill person ranting to themself. But, talking to yourself and mental illness aren\u2019t the same. Schizophrenics are often thought of as talking to themselves, but they\u2019re actually responding to auditory hallucinations. In other words, they\u2019re talking to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> voice in their mind, not themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking to yourself improves your ability to control and focus your mind on something important, whether that\u2019s preparing for a hard conversation, trying to find your keys, or upping your tennis game. While it might be embarrassing to get caught doing it, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with it. In fact, it\u2019s probably making you smarter, more focused, and more competitive than the person who caught you. So chat away and feel free to tell yourself how smart you are for doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many of us have an inner monologue.
