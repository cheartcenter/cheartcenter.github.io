When we eat well, get enough exercise and sleep, and limit our alcohol intake, we\u2019re helping our bodies function at their best. So when our bodies are out of whack, we can usually tell. But, when it comes to your vagina\u2019s health, it can be a little more mystifying. Plus, because we don\u2019t talk about it enough, it can sometimes be hard to know what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not. So how can you really tell if your vagina is healthy?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Wait, that isn\u2019t my vagina?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yep, you\u2019ve been lied to: your vagina is actually inside your body. The labia, urethra, and clitoris are often referred to as part of the vagina, but they\u2019re actually\u00a0part of the vulva. The vagina is basically a tube that runs between your vulva (the outside of your body) and your cervix.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do I know if my vagina is healthy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the vagina is internal, we can\u2019t really look at it and assess its health. This means we have to rely on other signs to keep tabs on our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vaginal health<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One big clue is discharge, which all vaginas produce. What\u2019s tricky is that healthy discharge doesn\u2019t have one appearance: it changes throughout the menstrual cycle. It can range from clear and slippery (sort of like an egg white) to white and creamy during a normal cycle. But discharge can also signal that something more is going on: it may have a strong odour or a different colour or consistency than you\u2019re used to. Because most girls aren\u2019t taught about vaginal discharge, it&#8217;s easy to mistake normal cyclical variations for something else \u2014 a yeast infection, for example. And pregnant women typically produce more discharge (it\u2019s often one of the first signs of pregnancy). If you do\u00a0notice your discharge changing, it\u2019s crucial that you see a healthcare provider to confirm symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I tell if something\u2019s wrong with my vagina?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay attention to any abnormal changes in your vagina. Itchiness, for example, is a sign that all is not right \u2014 a healthy vagina should not be itchy. Vaginal itching could be a sign of bacterial vaginosis, a yeast infection, or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Vaginal pain, whether or not it occurs during sex, is never normal and should always be checked. And finally, of course, it comes back to discharge: if you notice that your discharge is lumpy (like cottage cheese), green, yellow, or another colour, these can all be indications that something is going on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Vaginal health tests<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because certain conditions can be quite\u00a0similar, vaginal health home testing kits have come onto the market in the last few years. These tests are calibrated to measure pH levels in the vagina. The vagina maintains a<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/labmed.ucsf.edu\/sfghlab\/test\/pdf%5CpH_Vaginal_Test_POLICY.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slightly acidic pH level<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order\u00a0to keep bacteria in check, and its pH doesn&#8217;t usually change when you have a yeast infection, for instance. So if you notice signs of a yeast infection, but the pH level is lower than it should be, it could be an indication that you are suffering from bacterial vaginosis (BV) or another kind of infection. This isn\u2019t always the case, however, as the presence of\u00a0semen or blood, and the hormonal changes of menopause can all affect vaginal pH levels, so it\u2019s always good to get clinical confirmation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most home health tests can\u2019t definitively tell you what kind of infection you have. The best they can do is confirm your pH level. If the pH level is normal and you\u2019ve previously had a yeast infection and recognize the symptoms, then you can go ahead and\u00a0treat yourself with an over the counter (OTC) medication. But if the test comes back abnormal, you\u2019ll need to speak with a doctor to confirm a diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Yeast infections<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeast infections have come up a few times already, but it\u2019s because they\u2019re one of the most common vaginal health issues. Most women \u2014 about<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/infectious-diseases\/sexual-health-sexually-transmitted-infections\/canadian-guidelines\/sexually-transmitted-infections\/canadian-guidelines-sexually-transmitted-infections-26.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 will have a yeast infection at some point\u00a0in their life. Most women are familiar with the symptoms: vaginal itching and discomfort, cottage cheese-like discharge, and pain during sex or urination. But yeast infections don\u2019t always manifest with these exact symptoms. This can sometimes lead to a misdiagnosis when self-treating. If you find yourself experiencing multiple, recurrent yeast infections a year, speak with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There could be an underlying cause you\u2019re missing, or you may have misdiagnosed yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I keep my vagina healthy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow these tips to keep your vagina healthy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t douche \u2014 it can upset the normal pH balance of your vagina. There&#8217;s also no need as vaginas are self-cleaning.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear cotton underwear \u2014 synthetic fabrics don\u2019t breathe well and air will help your vagina maintain its balance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid wearing very\u00a0tight pants.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wipe front to back. Wiping the other way can introduce harmful anal bacteria into your vagina.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use condoms during sex to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/sexually-transmitted-disease-facts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">limit your exposure to STIs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change out of wet clothes or bathing suits as soon as possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basic hygiene and self-care are typically enough to keep your vagina healthy on a day-to-day basis. In addition, make sure to\u00a0get regular Pap tests, and use condoms each and\u00a0every time you have sex with new partners unless you are monogamous and know their health status. STIs and BV can cause serious complications if left untreated, including<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/bv\/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced fertility<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For pregnant women, there is also a risk of premature labour or low fetal birth weight (among other things). While you might feel embarrassed to talk about vaginal health, ignoring potential issues won\u2019t make them go away. Taking a minute to speak to your doctor about any concerns can make all the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vaginal health can be tricky: how do you know what&#8217;s really going on inside?
