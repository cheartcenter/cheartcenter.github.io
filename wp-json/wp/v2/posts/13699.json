One of the keys to good health is preventative maintenance like regular checkups and exams. When you skip health tests and screenings, you can miss the early signs of illness. Catching things early goes a long way towards favourable outcomes when it comes to your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.columbiavalleypioneer.com\/trending-now\/millennial-men-least-likely-to-have-a-family-doctor-statistics-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian men are less likely to go to the doctor than Canadian women, and millennial men are the least likely group to have regular visits with healthcare providers.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nobody\u2019s perfect, but if there are any tests that men out there really shouldn\u2019t skip, it\u2019s the ones below. Making these appointments non-negotiable is a big step towards the maintenance of your long-term health.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Blood pressure test<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have high blood pressure, your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.heartandstroke.ca\/heart\/risk-and-prevention\/condition-risk-factors\/high-blood-pressure\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, that can lead to serious illnesses, like heart disease and stroke.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Monitoring your blood pressure is helpful because if you catch it early, there are lots of interventions that healthcare professionals can recommend to correct high blood pressure. Changes to diet, reducing stress, and medication are all helpful solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/heart-health\/high-blood-pressure\/signs-symptoms-high-blood-pressure.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men should get their blood pressure checked at least once per year.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019ve had problems with your heart health in the past, you\u2019ll likely need to have more frequent tests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Cholesterol test<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitoring your cholesterol is a key part of maintaining your cardiovascular health. There\u2019s more than one type of cholesterol, and not all cholesterol is dangerous. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the type you don\u2019t want too much of in your bloodstream. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/lab-tests\/cholesterol-levels\/#:~:text=Too%20much%20LDL%20cholesterol%20in,can%20cause%20a%20heart%20attack.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It contributes to heart disease, and the buildup of plaque that blocks arteries and causes heart attacks.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/myhealth.alberta.ca\/Health\/pages\/conditions.aspx?hwid=aa76157\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every man over 40 years of age should have their cholesterol checked at least once.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After that, an assessment of your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/aa76157\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal and family history<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help you and your doctor decide how often to follow up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Testicular exam<\/h2>\n<p><b><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newswire.ca\/news-releases\/almost-two-thirds-of-canadian-men-aged-18-34-don-t-know-their-testicular-cancer-risk-885690275.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian men ages 18-34 years old are at highest risk of testicular cancer.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Protecting your testicular health requires a team effort. You\u2019ll need to do self-assessments, and schedule an annual exam with a healthcare practitioner. At home, you should start doing self examination in your 20s. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-type\/testicular\/finding-cancer-early\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familiarity with your body will help you find abnormalities more easily<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A testicular exam may be part of your annual physical with your doctor, especially if you have a family history of testicular cancer. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.testicularcancer.ngo\/your-health\/info-statistics#survival-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, testicular cancer has a great recovery rate, especially if caught early!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Preventative health maintenance<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you only commit to one of these tests, make it your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfp.ca\/content\/63\/11\/824\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preventive health checkup<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Over the years, advice about this appointment has changed a lot. You\u2019ve probably been told that getting an annual physical exam is a good health practise. But depending on your health, you don\u2019t need an annual physical <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/lifestyle\/is-an-annual-physical-necessary-the-doctor-is-out-on-that-one-1.2017959\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like was once thought.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Younger men or men living without health complications can stick to seeing a doctor every 2-3 years for a preventative health maintenance appointment. Your doctor will ask you questions about your lifestyle and give you advice about potential health risks based on your age and routines. Periodic appointments are suggested because the approach is more tailored. Your doctor can focus on giving you recommendations that are customized for you. Plus, it gives you a bit of a break. No one wants to be put through a bunch of tests that aren\u2019t really necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/menshealthfoundation.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have health conditions that need monitoring, or a history of health complications, see your doctor may suggest regular exams.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men tend to be stoic about preserving their health, but taking a preventative approach can help you feel more vital and have better long-term outcomes. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, our doctors are always available for guidance.
