They often prescribe medications to physically treat a condition alongside methods like talk therapy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologists, on the other hand, focus on your personal behaviours to diagnose mental illnesses. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They&#8217;ll often monitor sleep, behaviours, or eating habits, and probe into the negative thoughts that could be causing your issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difference in education\/training<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both psychologists and psychiatrists go through rigorous, extensive training in their fields, their education is very different from one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychiatrist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychiatrists are medical doctors, meaning they&#8217;ve earned a degree in medicine. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have much of the same training as a doctor you\u2019d see in a family practice, except they\u2019ve chosen to focus their expertise on treating mental illness and undergone an additional 4 or more years of training specifically in psychiatry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologists have a PhD in psychology, but aren\u2019t trained in medicine. That\u2019s why a psychologist can\u2019t prescribe medication.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, because of their focus on the behavioural and emotional causes of mental illness, they can often offer a wider variety of therapy options than a psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How psychiatrists and psychologists treat mental health concerns<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like their training, there are different treatment methods used by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psychiatrists vs psychologists<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychiatrist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they can write prescriptions, psychiatrists usually use a combination of medications and talk therapy to help address their patient&#8217;s issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When prescribing new medications, psychiatrists will request frequent updates from their patients to ensure the medications and dosages are helping. It can take some time to find the right dosage and\/or balance of medications to help a patient while having the least possible side effects.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don&#8217;t have the ability to give prescriptions to their patients, but psychologists often use different, more diverse types of therapy to diagnose and treat mental illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain unique types of therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, may be used to help uncover the underlying emotional causes of your mental illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common conditions treated by psychiatrists and psychologists<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since they don&#8217;t take the same training or follow the same methods for identifying\/treating mental illness, it makes sense that psychiatrists and psychologists treat different types of conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychiatrist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For someone with a very serious mental health problem, which might make it hard for them to take care of themselves, or someone who needs medication to adjust certain chemical levels in their brains, psychiatrists are a good choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of mental illnesses they treat are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/depression-treatment\/\">depression<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bipolar disorder<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schizophrenia<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the same token, if you have long-term emotional issues, are having difficulty processing traumatic events or have recently noticed changes in your emotional well-being, psychologists could be a good fit for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They treat mental illnesses such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/anxiety-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coping with phobias (fears)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/insomnia-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insomnia<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bottom line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, now that we&#8217;ve clarified all of that, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, they&#8217;re two different means to the same end. They both identify and treat mental illnesses for their patients. However, they each specialize in treating different kinds of mental illnesses, and often they offer treatments and solutions in different ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They both examine factors that could be causing your illness, but psychiatrists can offer prescriptions to their patients and psychologists can&#8217;t. Psychologists are trained in a different variety of specialty therapies for treating patients than psychiatrists.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re still not sure whether a psychiatrist or a psychologist is the right choice for you, the best first step is to talk with a GP. They can help determine the best course of treatment for you and order tests like blood work that may help determine if your concerns are caused by an emotional trigger or an underlying chemical imbalance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To securely and confidentially connect with one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychiatry\/\">psychiatrists<\/a> or GPs online, sign up for an account with Maple. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Navigating mental health challenges can be difficult \u2014 especially with so many professionals who all seem to have complex titles that start with \u201cpsych.\u201d So we\u2019re breaking down everything you need to know about two of the most commonly confused terms: psychiatry and psychology.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":10834,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[31],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v16.4 (Yoast SEO v16.4) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Psychiatry vs. Psychology: What&#039;s the difference? - Maple<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Navigating a mental health challenge is difficult.
