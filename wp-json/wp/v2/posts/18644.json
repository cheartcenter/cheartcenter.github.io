We may be spending more time indoors to escape Canada&#8217;s infamous cold, but that comes with its own set of challenges. Here are eight tips for keeping your skin and hair at their best.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay hydrated<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body prioritizes where it uses the water you consume. Your essential organs are at the top of the list, whereas your hair and skin are further down since they\u2019re less vital. That means if you\u2019re not getting enough water, your hair and skin won\u2019t get their fair share of hydration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy adults should drink nine to twelve 250 mL (8 fl oz) glasses of water or other fluid every day. Stick to herbal teas or beverages that are low in caffeine if plain water isn\u2019t for you. Liquids high in caffeine, sodium, and sugar like pop, coffee, or vegetable juices actually have a dehydrating effect.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dry skin is an indication of dehydration. Another simple way to tell if you\u2019re dehydrated is to look at your urine. It should normally be a light yellow colour. If it\u2019s darker yellow or brown, start drinking more <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/food-guide.canada.ca\/en\/healthy-eating-recommendations\/make-water-your-drink-of-choice\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dry, cold air can lead to hair breakage and a dry scalp. Staying hydrated stimulates your hair follicles so you keep producing new healthy strands, even in the dry winter air.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a humidifier<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold air doesn\u2019t carry much moisture, and neither does air produced by indoor heating systems. Whether you\u2019re inside or outside, there isn\u2019t much opportunity for your skin and hair to absorb moisture from your environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humidifiers put moisture back into the air by pumping steam through the room they\u2019re in. The resulting air moisture helps prevent your skin from getting dry and flaky, and minimizes breakage and split ends from dehydrated hair.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisturize your skin<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your skin is made up of several layers, and the topmost layer is called the epidermis. Your epidermis holds your skin\u2019s moisture. When there\u2019s not enough moisture in this layer, its cells break away. This can lead to itchy and flaky skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using body and face moisturizer daily helps nourish dry skin. Try applying it soon after washing your face or taking a shower. Since your skin has just been in contact with water, it has absorbed enough moisture to hydrate that outer skin layer. Applying moisturizer helps lock in hydration before it evaporates away. It also creates a barrier between your skin and the cold, harsh air.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try a gentle exfoliant<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting rid of flaky, dry skin with a gentle exfoliant helps the underlying cells stay moisturized. Exfoliating gets debris and dead skin out of the way so that when you moisturize, you\u2019re protecting healthy cells without trapping dead ones overtop. This helps your skin stay clear, smooth, and hydrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can exfoliate manually with tools like sponges, brushes, or a towel. You can also use facial scrubs with granules, which dislodge dead cells. Chemical exfoliants are also available, which gently dissolve the top layer of your skin.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat healthy fats<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consuming healthy fats is essential for skin, hair, and nail maintenance. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are best for hair and skin health. Your body can\u2019t make them on its own, so the only way to reap the benefits is by working them into your diet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods that contain healthy fats include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nuts and seeds, like walnuts or flax seeds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fish, like salmon, tuna or mackerel<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canola oil or soybean oil<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kidney beans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edamame<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tofu<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peanut butter<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avocado<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use sunscreen<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sun is always emitting UV rays, even if it\u2019s not a sunny day. Especially when there\u2019s snow on the ground, the sun\u2019s rays can be surprisingly strong. Snow reflects the sunlight, making UV rays even more powerful.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing sunscreen every day is a good practice to protect your skin year round. Sun exposure can lead to dehydration, causing the skin to lose elasticity. Over time, UV rays can also cause skin cancer.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of moisturizers on the market with SPF built in. The Canadian Dermatology Association recommends using a minimum of SPF 30 daily.Try working one into your daily routine this winter to get the benefits of moisturized, UV protected skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimize hot showers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As nice as a hot shower feels on a cold day, it\u2019s not great for maintaining healthy skin. Hot water damages a protein in your skin called keratin, which protects your skin from easily tearing. When it becomes weakened your skin gets flaky. In combination with the dry air in winter, this can lead to cracked, painful skin. Opt for water that\u2019s warm instead of hot next time you\u2019re washing off.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try a hydrating hair routine<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s hair has a different level of porosity, which is the amount of water or oils a strand of hair is able to absorb and retain. Dry air can lower your hair\u2019s porosity, making it harder for your hair shaft to lock in the moisture it needs. In winter, changing your hair care routine could help optimize your hair\u2019s moisture levels. Here\u2019s where you can start:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid heat styling tools, like blow dryers or straighteners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid dehydrating hair products, like gels high in alcohol.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t wash your hair more often than necessary.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seal hydration into your hair using oils.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opt for ammonia-free dyes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid chemical hair straighteners.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold air and dry indoor heat can cause all sorts of hair and skin challenges. This season, consider experimenting with the foods you eat, humidifying your home, and adding hydration to your hair and skincare routines. The right combination will keep your hair and skin healthy all season long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Book an appointment with a dermatologist for a personalized plan to help minimize seasonal damage to your hair and skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cold winter conditions can dry out your hair and skin.
