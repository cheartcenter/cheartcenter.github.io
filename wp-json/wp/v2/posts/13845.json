When it comes to\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building your daily mental health practice, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all routine. To build a mental health routine that works, start with a few additions to your daily routine and see what sticks. Your efforts don\u2019t have to be grand gestures. Be gentle with yourself, and start small.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of chances to boost your emotional state throughout the day. A little experimentation is all you need to find the strategies that work for you. Here are some attainable ways to start a daily mental health routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice mindfulness meditation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindfulness meditation is a technique that helps reduce stress by slowing down your thoughts. This helps you move your focus away from negative emotions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindfulness meditation is rooted in breathing exercises that keep you focused on the present moment<\/span><b>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies have shown that meditation makes you <a href=\"https:\/\/greatergood.berkeley.edu\/article\/item\/the_state_of_mindfulness_science#:~:text=According%20to%20neuroscience%20research%2C%20mindfulness,stress%20when%20we%20experience%20it.\">less distractible<\/a> and improves your resilience to stress.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get started by dedicating as little as five minutes a day to developing your practice<\/span><b>.\u00a0 <\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Get some exercise<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting proper exercise benefits your mental and physical health. If you\u2019re having a tough day, physical <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">activity is shown to have positive effects on your mood <a href=\"https:\/\/cihr-irsc.gc.ca\/e\/49753.html\">almost instantly<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are long term mental health benefits from exercise too. It reduces stress and anxiety by releasing neurotransmitters that help you manage your mood, like serotonin. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Canada, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/reports-publications\/health-promotion-chronic-disease-prevention-canada-research-policy-practice\/vol-37-no-5-2017\/self-management-mood-anxiety-disorders-physical-activity-exercise.html\">half of those<\/a> living with mood disorders or anxiety don\u2019t exercise.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You don\u2019t have to run a marathon to see results. Start with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 minutes of exercise, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1470658\/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.\">three days per week<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you\u2019re looking to boost your mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Get quality sleep<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting quality sleep gives you a headstart on good mental health each day. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">36%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"> of<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"> Canadian adults<\/a> who don\u2019t get proper sleep also report chronic stress. The tough thing about sleep issues is that they lead to stress, which leads to more trouble sleeping \u2014 and the cycle continues. You can counter this by sticking to a bedtime routine. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try limiting screen time before bed, or going to bed at the same time each night.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\"> Developing a predictable routine<\/a> around sleep can help put your mind at ease when it\u2019s time to rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Eat brain-friendly foods<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food can help improve your mood. Not the treats you may be thinking, like a cookie for a job well done. Try foods that are rich in vitamin B-12 and folate if you\u2019re looking for ways to fight depression \u2014 like fish, nutritional yeast, or beef. Vitamin D from dairy products is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked to an <a href=\"https:\/\/cdhf.ca\/health-lifestyle\/mental-health-and-nutrition\/\">increase in dopamine<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which helps with mood regulation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you can, plan meals that are low in sugar and refined carbohydrates during periods where you know you\u2019re likely to be stressed out. Sugar and carbohydrates <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cause <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/ca\/blog\/diagnosis-diet\/201702\/clinical-trial-finds-diet-works-depression\">spikes in blood sugar<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hormones. This ultimately leaves you feeling even more off-balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Reduce your screen time<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our phones, tablets, and televisions are our windows to the world. But every once in a while, taking a break is a good thing. There are lots of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/canada\/article-new-review-of-evidence-suggests-association-between-excessive-screen\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to support limiting the screentime of children and young adults, and adult <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalalert.com\/too-much-screen-time-is-bad-for-kids-and-adults\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are trending in the same direction. Excessive screen time has been linked to a reduction in gray matter in the adult brain. When this happens in your frontal lobe, it can lead to problems with impulse control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next time you\u2019re looking for a reset, consider doing it the old fashioned way. Try a print version of a magazine or newspaper instead of scrolling on your phone.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Get into nature<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you live with mental illness or not, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/naturecanada.ca\/tag\/positive-mental-health\/#:~:text=Research%20is%20showing%20that%20for,component%20of%20treatment%5Bv%5D.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nature has a positive impact on mood.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When you feel stress or anxiety, your body produces cortisol. Cortisol stops us from relaxing \u2014 it\u2019s the hormone that kept humans on their toes in the presence of predators millions of years ago. Even though you\u2019re more likely to see a predator at the zoo than in daily life, your body still releases cortisol in reaction to stress. Nature\u2019s calming effect on the mind and body reduces the production of hormones that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ontarioparks.com\/parksblog\/mental-health-benefits-outdoors\/#:~:text=Relieving%20anxiety%2C%20stress%2C%20and%20depression&amp;text=Countless%20studies%20have%20proven%20that,nature%20and%20reduced%20negative%20emotions.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contribute to anxiety and depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to venture into the wilderness to get the benefits of a natural setting. Start with a nearby park or rooftop garden to see if being near green space makes you feel at ease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Stick to a routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially when you run a business or a household, a schedule or routine can be an excellent tool for organizing your busy mind. That\u2019s because it limits the number of decisions you have to make each day. Routine prevents <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/womensmedia\/2019\/05\/13\/how-to-identify-when-youre-experiencing-decision-fatigue\/#6948266c7fb4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decision fatigue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 where you tire yourself out by getting bogged down by a bunch of small repetitive decisions. When you plan things like what you\u2019ll wear, or what you\u2019ll have for lunch, you\u2019re less likely to experience decision fatigue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning ahead leaves you with more mental capacity to dedicate to bigger, more complex daily challenges. Try planning your lunches in advance this week and see if it makes your day feel smoother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many ways to approach improving your mental health.
