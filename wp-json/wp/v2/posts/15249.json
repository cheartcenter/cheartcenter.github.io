Intense allergy sufferers often find that over-the-counter medication doesn\u2019t provide relief. If you\u2019re one of those people, it\u2019s probably time for you to see an allergist.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergists are doctors that specialize in treating people with environmental or hereditary sensitivities. And while it\u2019s common to see them for cold symptoms or respiratory troubles, that\u2019s not all they can treat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From food sensitivities to rash prevention, allergists can help you discover what your body reacts to poorly <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you have a reaction. They\u2019re able to treat a range of conditions, and can teach you what to avoid so you can keep operating at your best. Here\u2019s a look at the types of tests allergists do, and the conditions they can help you overcome.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of tests do allergists do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two common tests that allergists perform: skin tests and blood tests.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin tests<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin tests, sometimes called patch tests, prick tests or scratch tests, are tests done to your skin to gauge your body\u2019s reaction to allergens. An allergen is a substance that could cause an allergic reaction in someone with a sensitivity to it. During the test, a small amount of the allergen is applied to your skin. If the area swells or reddens, you\u2019re likely allergic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blood tests<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to find out if you have an allergy is through a blood test<\/span><b>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergists look for immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE are antibodies that your body produces when your immune system perceives a threat. When you have allergies, your body produces IgE in reaction to things that aren\u2019t actually dangerous, like pollen from flowers, or animal dander. An allergist can measure the total amount of IgE in your blood to make a general diagnosis about whether or not your symptoms are part of an allergic reaction. They can also get specific, and test your blood for its reaction to a particular allergen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What kind of illnesses can allergists treat?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone\u2019s body is different. Your tolerance for certain allergens may range. Allergists can help you get to the bottom of mild symptoms, like indigestion after eating dairy. They can also test you for severe allergies, and prevent life-threatening reactions. Here are some conditions an allergist can help with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sinus infections<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sinus infection is when your sinuses \u2014 which start above your brow and run down your nose on either side of your face \u2014 become inflamed. This leads to fluid buildup, which results in congestion and a runny nose. Sinus infections are most often caused by viruses like the common cold, or allergens like pet dander. If you find yourself constantly battling sinus irritation, even when you don\u2019t have other cold symptoms, an allergist can help figure out the cause.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye irritation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye inflammation caused by an allergic reaction is called <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/allergyasthma.on.ca\/patient\/allergic-conjunctivitis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergic conjunctivitis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Allergens irritate the membrane on the outer surface of your eye and cause itching, swelling, and redness. Sometimes this happens to people seasonally, and they can predict when their eyes will be affected. For others it\u2019s more spontaneous. It could happen in reaction to contact with dust mites, or cosmetics that contain allergens. Finding the source of the irritation will teach you which ingredients to avoid.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anaphylaxis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction. When it happens your immune system goes into attack mode, releasing a flood of chemicals to eliminate an allergen intruder. The reaction dilates your airways, making it suddenly difficult to breathe. People who have allergies that put them at risk for going into anaphylactic shock should carry an epi pen. It contains epinephrine, and can bring your body out of the reaction by increasing your blood pressure. That calms your pulse and reopens your airways.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anaphylaxis is a common reaction to peanut or shellfish allergies. It\u2019s possible to detect these allergies before an attack with a skin prick test.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asthma<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lungsask.ca\/about-us\/news-room\/backgrounders-and-information-sheets\/asthma-fact-sheet#:~:text=At%20present%2C%20almost%203%20million,12%20and%20older%20had%20asthma.&amp;text=In%202000%2C%20almost%2016%25%20of,4%20to%2011%20had%20asthma.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the three million Canadians who have asthma<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, environmental sensitivities can be a real danger. Asthma attacks can be brought on by allergens like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, or food sensitivities. This is known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/asthma\/in-depth\/allergies-and-asthma\/art-20047458#:~:text=Allergies%20and%20asthma%20often%20occur,asthma%20or%20allergy%2Dinduced%20asthma.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergy-induced asthma<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hay fever<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes a lot of the same symptoms as the common cold. But the sneezing, coughing, itchy eyes and sinus pain aren\u2019t caused by the cold virus. They\u2019re induced by allergens. Hay fever can happen to anyone, but you usually get it for the first time when you\u2019re young. There are different allergens common during spring, summer, and fall that contribute to hay fever, making it possible to develop symptoms year-round. A visit with an allergist can help you determine whether the illness you\u2019re experiencing is a viral cold, or hay fever brought on by allergens.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin allergies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can learn a lot about your health through your skin. Itchy skin can be an indication of a wide range of intolerances, from food sensitivity to an allergy to chemicals in household products. Through skin tests or examining your rash, an allergist can determine whether your diet or environment are causing symptoms on your skin. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food allergies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food allergies affect approximately <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/food-allergies-intolerances\/food-allergies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6% of young children and 4% of adults<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in western countries like Canada. Some food allergies are life threatening, so they should be taken seriously. A trip to the allergist can help you catch food allergies early. This can be especially useful for little ones who are about to start school for the first time. Knowing of any allergies early will help keep kids safe while they\u2019re away from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your unique physical makeup, hereditary traits, and environmental exposure all influence your body\u2019s tolerance to allergens. Through tests, you can narrow down a list of sensitivities unique to your makeup and get to the bottom of nerve-wracking allergic reactions. For perennial allergy sufferers, our allergists can strategize symptom management to keep you feeling your best year round.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you sneezing because of the common cold, or are allergies keeping your nose permanently stuffed?
