From remembering passwords to driving your car, your brain is constantly drawing on its cognitive abilities. Changes to your brain, such as trauma or atrophy, can affect how well your cognitive function works. You can learn more about your overall brain function and cognitive health through a standardized test called cognitive assessment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitive functions you use everyday<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most important cognitive functions are:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attention\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attention is your ability to maintain focus on a given task. In situations where there\u2019s a number of stimuli, your attention is what helps you prioritize where to focus your concentration. Short-term, this allows you to make snap decisions. You also use your attention to hold focus on tasks that require concentration over longer periods of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memory<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memory is your ability to encode, store, process, and later retrieve information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory is what allows you to remember things while you\u2019re processing them. It\u2019s how you keep small pieces of information, like a phone number someone recites to you, in mind just long enough to use it. Long-term memory is information that you keep with you for extended periods, even your whole life, like the name of your first pet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Language\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This complex mental task is active when you read, write, and speak. Your ability to build your vocabulary or speak a language fluently is influenced by your cognitive strength in this area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive function\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what you use to control your behaviour. It\u2019s the self-regulation required to prioritize tasks, set long-term goals, or stay in control of your emotional response.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visual and spatial ability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the abilities that allow you to understand where objects are in space, and how objects are related. Visual and spatial awareness also allows you to imagine two dimensional objects in different arrangements and recognize people\u2019s faces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Praxis\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Praxis is also referred to as learned motor ability. It\u2019s your ability to plan and execute physical movements. It also includes how well you\u2019re able to reflect on physical movements you\u2019ve made, and adapt accordingly. This function is at work during activities like learning to swim, or perfecting a golf swing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orientation\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orientation is your sense of self in different contexts. When you\u2019re with other people, orientation is what helps you distinguish yourself as an individual. It\u2019s also the ability to locate yourself in time and understand the meaning of minutes, months, or years. There\u2019s a physical component to orientation too. It helps you maintain awareness of your body within a space.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a cognitive assessment?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cognitive assessment is a standardized test done by an occupational therapist. The test evaluates your cognitive skills, and can be done remotely. Knowing which parts of your brain are functioning at full capacity, and which parts are not can help create a clearer picture of your overall neurofunction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brainfx.com\/brainfx-training\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neurofunction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a map of how well your physical, cognitive, and psychosocial abilities are working. There are 25 cognitive skills that can be tested during a cognitive assessment, including attention, communication, memory, comprehension and judgment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who should get a cognitive assessment?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone can benefit from a cognitive assessment. It\u2019s helpful to know your cognitive strengths and weaknesses for a few reasons. Cognitive assessments help your doctor form customized treatment plans. With your assessment results, your doctor will know exactly which areas of cognitive function to help you develop. For people who aren\u2019t immediately concerned about their cognitive function, an assessment is a way to establish a baseline for your cognitive health. As you age, your doctor can refer to previous assessments to understand how your neurofunction may be changing over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your age and medical history are strong indicators as to why you may want to have a cognitive assessment sooner rather than later. We\u2019ve shared some examples below:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Older adults<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitive function naturally decreases over time. As you age, the structure of your brain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dana.org\/article\/cognitive-skills-and-the-aging-brain-what-to-expect\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There\u2019s a network of information highways in your brain called dendrites that send and receive chemical signals from other cells. As you get older they lose their complexity and reach. That makes it harder for information to move back and forth, leading to cognitive decline. Cognitive decline is associated with specific medical conditions such as dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Significant cognitive decline doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. Research is still being done on exactly which age decline starts, but some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/315421\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies show<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it can be as early as your 40s. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4906299\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most common<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> changes to cognitive ability as you get older include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decreased ability to quickly process information.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impaired decision making.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decreased executive function.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memory loss.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your cognitive function begins to decline, this can make it harder to lead a fully independent lifestyle. It can become difficult to navigate the world around you when your brain doesn\u2019t function as well as it used to. Understanding your baseline cognitive function can help you plan how to slow the onset of age-related cognitive changes.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. People who\u2019ve had head injuries<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were in an accident where you suffered a head injury, a cognitive assessment is a way to gauge the impact of that incident on your brain function. Some people with a brain injury may not notice a change in cognitive function immediately. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alz.org\/alzheimers-dementia\/what-is-dementia\/related_conditions\/traumatic-brain-injury#:~:text=The%20study%2C%20published%20in%20PLOS,dementia%20even%2030%20years%20later.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show that concussions increase the risk of dementia up to 30 years after their occurence. With a cognitive assessment, potential damage from head injuries can be identified and treated early.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your brain function has a direct impact on to your quality of life. A cognitive assessment can help you understand your brain\u2019s strengths, and give insight into ways you can improve your neurofunction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re curious about your brain function, speak to one of our occupational therapists. You can take a BrainFx Virtual Cognitive Assessment from home using your phone, tablet, or computer.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cognitive assessments can help you understand the health of your brain and overall neurofunction.
