One great place to start is boosting your immune system. A strong immune system will lower your risk of contracting infectious diseases, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/coronavirus-everything-you-need-to-know\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronaviruses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and help you recover quicker if you do get sick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body\u2019s immune system is a network of defense mechanisms that identifies and fights off infections. It works best when you\u2019re taking care of your overall health. Here are some simple but powerful ways to achieve that goal:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat a healthy diet<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy foods give your body the strength it needs to fight off disease. Experts recommend including plenty of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet. This provides essential nutrients such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/food-guide.canada.ca\/en\/healthy-eating-recommendations\/make-it-a-habit-to-eat-vegetables-fruit-whole-grains-and-protein-foods\/eat-vegetables-and-fruits\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vitamins, minerals and fiber<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For the biggest impact, try to mix it up and incorporate a wide variety of fruits and veggies such as pears, apples, berries, cabbage, broccoli and leafy greens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that fruit juices aren&#8217;t considered an equal substitute for whole fruits. Juices contain sugar in a pure form, while whole fruits retain fiber and other nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drink lots of water<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your immune system relies on water to keep operating at full force. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/debunking-myths-avoid-cure-coronavirus\/story?id=69578209\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hydration assists with many of your body\u2019s functions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including temperature regulation. If you\u2019re sick, your body will require more water to cope with a fever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can hydrate by drinking simple H2O, but if you want some variety you can also try herbal tea and fruit-infused water. Caffeinated drinks aren&#8217;t optimal for boosting hydration since they have a diuretic effect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be careful not to over hydrate though. Drinking too much water can actually be harmful to your health as it disrupts your electrolyte balance. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth noting that drinking water will <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> flush the coronavirus out of your system. That rumour has been circulating, but you can\u2019t flush a virus out of your airways by consuming fluids. Still, drinking water is a great idea to keep your immune system in top form.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep 7-9 hours per night<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A poor night\u2019s sleep can make you feel groggy, and it will also do a number on your immune system. Studies have shown that getting insufficient sleep negatively affects your T cells, which are essential for fighting off illness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night. During this time your body repairs any stress or damage from the previous day, while bolstering your immune system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor sleep is also associated with increased stress. Stress does no favours to your immune system \u2014\u00a0more on this below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow hygiene guidelines<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to lower your risk for coronavirus is to follow <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/publications-detail\/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">official public health guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The general public should:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash your hands regularly, for at least 20 seconds each time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid leaving your home for non-essential trips<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nationalpost.com\/news\/world\/covid-19-what-is-social-distancing-and-how-to-do-it-properly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social distancing<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re feeling sick, it\u2019s important to take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/symptoms.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extra precautions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in addition to the above:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover your cough with a tissue or elbow<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-isolate (more on that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-5-ws-of-self-isolation-and-self-quarantine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit a healthcare professional (virtually if possible) or call your local public health authority<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor your symptoms for 14 days, even if they\u2019re mild<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear a face mask when around other people<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following these guidelines will reduce your exposure to the coronavirus, and lessen the burden on your immune system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop smoking or vaping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s never been a better time to quit smoking. Since the novel coronavirus attacks the lungs, anyone with a weakened respiratory system is at higher risk of becoming sick. This includes people who smoke or vape. According to global health expert <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fqw-9yMV0sI\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alanna Shaikh<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cIf you\u2019re a smoker and you\u2019re worried about COVID-19, I guarantee that quitting is the best thing you can do to protect yourself from the worst impacts of COVID-19.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise moderately<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be difficult to exercise while you\u2019re self-isolating at home, but try to move around a bit. Follow along with a cardio youtube video, do some stretching, or try a few sit-ups. Exercise can help boost your spirits, and also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2020\/mar\/08\/how-to-boost-your-immune-system-to-avoid-colds-and-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobilizes your white blood cells<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Just be sure not to overdo it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid alcohol, or drink in moderation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid the temptation to spice up your quarantine with a couple glasses of wine. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4590612\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol is shown to have a negative effect on your whole immune system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Alcohol is also dehydrating, which further compromises your body.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s more, excessive alcohol consumption is linked to pneumonia \u2014 a dangerous complication of COVID-19, especially in senior citizens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage your stress<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recommendation might seem cheeky in the face of constant news headlines, school closures and public anxiety, but try not to stress. Take comfort in the fact that by following public health guidelines, you\u2019re doing your part to reduce the rate of COVID-19 infection across the population.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s little anyone can do about the coronavirus except be patient. In the meantime, manage your stress by listening to music, doing yoga, or following guided meditation. And make sure to stay connected to friends and family online or over the phone \u2014social interaction is a proven way to relieve stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your immune system is your front-line defense against the coronavirus. To keep it going strong, take care of your overall well being. Your diet, sleep schedule and lifestyle habits play a huge role in how your body handles any infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel like you may be experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19, the first step is to be screened by a doctor to assess your risk factors and symptoms. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t self-diagnose or head straight to a testing facility. Not every cold is COVID-19 after all and if you don\u2019t have it, the testing centre is the last place you want to be. Instead <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.gov.on.ca\/en\/common\/system\/services\/phu\/locations.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact your local public health unit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or use an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online screening service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like ours, which is currently covered by OHIP in Ontario.
