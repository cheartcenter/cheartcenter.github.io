Know your options for getting through it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a new parent, a sick child can be terrifying. Imagine that it\u2019s 2 am and your little one has woken up, crying, with a fever. Their little body is boiling hot, their skin is sweaty and feels as though it\u2019s on fire. You take their temperature and give them medicine, the<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1566174622325_8756239177128928\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><span id=\"selectionBoundary_1566174622331_16765162824387958\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span> appropriate\u00a0dose for their body weight. You snuggle them tightly and bring them into bed, trying to get them to fall asleep. Suddenly their breathing becomes raspy and they begin coughing, a horrible, hacking bark. You panic. They\u2019ve never been sick with more than a fever, and you don\u2019t know what to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your doctor\u2019s office is closed, and the last thing you need is to call the telehealth line, wait on hold for an hour, and then be told to go to the ER \u201cjust to be on the safe side.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you\u2019re lucky enough to live within an hour\u2019s drive of a good children\u2019s hospital, but even with that advantage, you know that at this late hour it\u2019ll be hours before you\u2019re seen by a doctor. The last thing a sick child needs is to be woken up, crammed into a car seat and driven downtown to wait in a brightly lit ER, surrounded by other crying children. You desperately want to speak with a doctor, but wonder if waiting in emerge will do more harm than good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the situation Alex found herself in a few months ago. &#8220;My son is our first child, and neither my husband nor I knew what to do. When you hear your child\u2019s breathing change like that, it\u2019s terrifying. We obviously\u00a0knew he had to see a doctor\u00a0but I was nervous about putting him in the car seat with him sounding like that.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I\u2019m so thankful we knew about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\">Maple<\/a> and could speak to a doctor in less than five minutes. After hearing and observing our son, the doctor diagnosed croup. Not only that, he was able to send a prescription to our closest 24-hour pharmacy. I was able to give my son the medicine he needed in under an hour and a half from the time he woke up with his illness! I\u2019m certain that we would have been waiting in the ER for longer than that if we had driven him to the hospital.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Emergency Room<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read a million of those \u201cwhat no one tells you about being a new parent\u201d lists, but none of them prepare you for the fear you can feel when it\u2019s your child who is sick. ER wait times in Canada have been climbing over the past few years, and one out of three Canadians reports waiting in the ER for four hours or more to see a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doctor<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you live in an urban centre, that\u2019s bad enough, but if you live in a rural area, chances are you\u2019re far enough from a hospital that the drive itself can add hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Clinic<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you find yourself with a pressing medical issue during regular business hours, a walk-in clinic isn\u2019t on any parents\u2019 list of dream destinations. Clinics are full of sick people, and sick people are full of germs! Paediatrician\u2019s offices are no exception, and frankly, given how unconcerned children are about spreading their germs, and how likely you are to find toys there for waiting patients, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re actually worse than adult clinics. Alex continues, &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I once took my son to see his dermatologist at the children\u2019s clinic, and he came down with the flu a few days later. I doubt it was a coincidence.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of people choose to\u00a0avoid seeing the doctor when they themselves are sick. As an adult, you can often tell if you have a cold or something more serious, but children can&#8217;t. And forget \u201cgoogling\u201d their symptoms; a cough and a fever can be something relatively benign, or symptoms of an endless parade of horrible diseases. For a parent with a sick child, trying to diagnose your little one this way is likely to make you feel much worse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple provides access to care from literally anywhere. As a parent, having a tool like Maple at hand makes an experience like your child\u2019s illness that much easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Wondering how we\u00a0can help?
