We\u2019ve already covered the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reasons <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-importance-of-sleep-are-you-really-getting-enough\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why\u00a0sleep is important<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and what the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/lack-of-sleep-side-effects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side effects of sleep deprivation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be. This time we&#8217;re speaking to one of our favourite sleep therapists, Aaron Arkin, for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> some of his favourite <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep hygiene tips. Sleep hygiene, in case you&#8217;re wondering, isn&#8217;t about how clean your sheets are, it has to do with the healthy habits and behaviours we put in place to help us get a better night&#8217;s rest. So read on to learn<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to sleep better at night, naturally<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Respect the function of your bed<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arkin is a stickler for this one and for good reason. Sleep hygiene is crucial for a good night\u2019s sleep, and the pinnacle of it all is your bed. That means that other than getting busy, and getting some shut-eye, there\u2019s nothing else you should be doing in your bed. There\u2019s no need to start answering emails or jumping on Slack for one last look. Making sure you use your bed for only sleep or sex, cues your body that it\u2019s time for one of those when you lie down. So save the snacking, movie watching, Facebook scrolling and sit-ups for basically\u00a0anywhere else in your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Pay attention to your sleep environment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever fallen asleep on the beach or out in the sun? Besides the risk of waking up with a sunburn, you\u2019re also likely to feel groggy and decidedly\u00a0unrested. Dehydration likely has something to do with it, but also the heat. Our bodies much prefer a cool space. Nocturnal lowering of our body temperature is associated with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3427038\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">production of melatonin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is one of our body\u2019s cues that it\u2019s time to go night-night (it\u2019s called thermoregulation). Keeping your sleep environment quiet, cool and clean is key to a good night\u2019s sleep (and yet another reason why\u00a0you shouldn\u2019t eat\u00a0 in bed). So grab some blackout blinds, wash your sheets and look into a fan or a white noise machine to mask your noisy neighbours.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Have a soothing pre-bedtime routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever sleep trained a baby, you\u2019ll know how important this is. A bedtime routine cues our brain that we\u2019re winding down, and it\u2019s important to make it as calming as possible. Some find a warm bath helpful \u2014 as your body cools, it mimics the thermoregulation process. If you\u2019re not a bath person though, sticking to the same actions in the same order should be enough. Wash your face, brush your teeth, change into jammies and read a chapter of a good book. Don\u2019t read on a screen, though \u2014 you\u2019ve heard it many times before, but screen time should end an hour before bedtime. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/articles\/why-electronics-may-stimulate-you-bed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electronic screen light<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> messes up our body\u2019s internal clock, so we don\u2019t produce melatonin when we should. Even if it doesn\u2019t stop you falling asleep, you may experience a less restful night and have trouble staying asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Make pro-sleep lifestyle adjustments<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one\u2019s suggesting you reconfigure your life around sleeping, but consider small practical changes. Move your afternoon coffee back earlier in the day \u2014 instead of a cappuccino every afternoon at two, try to finish your last cup by noon. Try to take time to walk outside, since getting enough sunlight is crucial. The bartenders and shift workers of the world know that sleeping until 3pm never made anyone feel good. Even if you\u2019re in that line of work, make an effort to get up and get an hour of sunlight before getting ready for work again, it can make a huge difference. And don\u2019t forget to exercise \u2014 it\u2019s the best way to help yourself to a better night\u2019s sleep. Plus it\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/heart-health-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">good for your heart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Develop an overall routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While those weekend sleep-in sessions can be delicious, they can mess up your circadian rhythms. If you\u2019re normally up at 6:30, sleeping until 10 am is likely to delay your bedtime that night and may make it harder to wake up the following morning. And if you have work or school the next day, you\u2019re likely to end up with a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep deficiency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sticking to the same wake up and bedtime each day means your body knows what\u2019s coming next. If you do\u00a0have a late night and have trouble keeping it together the next morning, your best bet is to try a short (20 to 40 minute) power nap. Our bodies get used to sleeping at certain times and for a certain amount of time. Sticking to a regular\u00a0routine all week keeps you from having to prop yourself up with three million cups of coffee to make it through the day. So try and stay with a consistent schedule, seven days a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us have trouble sleeping from time to time. Ideally we\u2019re able to get back on track and recover after a day or two. If you find that you\u2019ve tried these tricks and you\u2019re still dealing with a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lack of sleep, treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from a professional might be your next step. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of lack of sleep can cause<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all sorts of issues. And it\u2019s hard to do much of anything when you\u2019re not sleeping enough. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/sleep-therapist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sleep therapists are here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for you, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sleep hygiene \u2014 it&#8217;s not about how clean your bed sheets are, but about creating the best sleep environment possible.
