Why and which procedure you want are always up to you. But while cosmetic surgery is usually safe, it isn\u2019t regulated the same way that necessary surgeries (like brain surgery) are. Because of that, it\u2019s up to the consumer to make sure that\u00a0they protect themselves by picking the right doctor. To do that, you need to know what to ask them. These five questions are a crucial part of how to choose your cosmetic surgeon.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Are you a member of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons?<\/h2>\n<p>Many think that\u00a0plastic and cosmetic surgery are the same thing. You\u2019ll know from reading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/one-womans-plastic-surgery-experience\/\">our blog<\/a>, however, that training can vary widely between two doctors doing the same procedures. Doctors who are members of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons, have extensive training in plastic surgery. While that seems like it should be a given, it\u2019s not. Plastic surgeons undergo five years of <a href=\"http:\/\/plasticsurgery.ca\/about\/choose-plastic-surgeon\/\">additional training<\/a> in plastic and cosmetic surgery after medical school in order\u00a0to call themselves plastic surgeons. Cosmetic surgeons on the other hand,\u00a0are \u201cregular doctors,\u201d often dentists or dermatologists, with some additional training. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t mean that it has to come down to a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cosmetic surgery vs. plastic surgery<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> situation, as there are some highly skilled cosmetic surgeons<\/span>. But it is important to know what kind of training your doctor has.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Do you have hospital admitting privileges?<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully your procedure goes off without a hitch and you don\u2019t have to worry about this part, but it\u2019s a good idea to check\u00a0anyway. A doctor with admitting privileges at a hospital can immediately arrange your transition to that hospital should the need arise. Doctors are the gatekeepers at hospitals. If your doctor doesn\u2019t have these privileges they will need to get another doctor to admit you, potentially causing delay. And once you\u2019re in, their privileges allow them to order any tests you might need or book an operating room, again saving precious time.<\/p>\n<h2>3. What is your experience with the procedure you will be doing?<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you go with a certified plastic surgeon or a cosmetic surgeon, this is a \u201cmust ask\u201d question. While helping someone who\u2019s just starting out in their career is nice, you don\u2019t want a novice doing your facelift. The more experience a doctor has with a given\u00a0procedure, the more complications they know how to deal with. They\u2019ve also had a chance to practice more and to hone their skills. But knowing how long they\u2019ve been doing the procedure isn\u2019t enough. Just because someone started playing piano 10 years ago doesn\u2019t mean they practice regularly \u2014 the same with surgery. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your doctor, not only how long they\u2019ve been doing the procedure, but also how many times a year they do it.<\/p>\n<h2>4. What happens if I don\u2019t like the results?<\/h2>\n<p>No one really wants to think about this as a possibility, but you need to know what your options are. We may go into cosmetic surgery thinking we\u2019ll emerge as an ideal version of ourselves. While we can hope that this happens, it\u2019s not always the case. A good surgeon will not only manage your expectations by setting realistic goals, they\u2019ll also let you know what they are willing to do if you don\u2019t like the results. This goes beyond not liking the results, however. Not every procedure goes according to plan. Your surgeon has a legal obligation to inform you of possible\u00a0complications that can occur. They should also go over what they would do to rectify that situation. It\u2019s incredibly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/medical-malpractice-doctors-lawsuits-canada-1.4913960\">difficult to sue a doctor<\/a> for malpractice in Canada, so this is a crucial component of shopping for a surgeon.<\/p>\n<h2>5. What kind of anesthesia do you require for this procedure? Who will be in charge of it?<\/h2>\n<p>Different procedures require the administration of different anesthesia. General anesthesia involves putting you to sleep for a period of time, and typically requires a bit of preparation. Local anesthesia can be as simple as applying a numbing cream before doing a mole removal. Because anesthesia depends on which procedure you are getting, it\u2019s important to understand who will be giving it and what the possible\u00a0side effects might be. While death during general anesthesia is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3147285\/\">extremely\u00a0rare<\/a>, it is still a possibility. Because of this, general anesthesia must be administered by an anesthesiologist, a doctor specializing in giving anesthesia. You may have heard the term \u201canesthetist\u201d\u00a0as well, meaning another medical practitioner (typically a nurse), who has training in giving anesthesia. While anesthetists are highly trained, and can administer pain medication in certain circumstances, in Canada, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cas.ca\/English\/who-are-anesthesiologists\">only anesthesiologists<\/a> can supervise a patient who will be under general anesthesia.<\/p>\n<p>While these questions about your cosmetic surgery are a great starting point, don\u2019t consider them a comprehensive list. Their answers are only part of what to expect during your cosmetic surgery consultation. Your initial consultation should go over your procedure\u00a0in detail, as well as your health history and what you\u2019re hoping to achieve. Don\u2019t be afraid to come with a long list of questions to ask your cosmetic or plastic surgeon. A good surgeon should show you pictures of previous examples of their work, as well as run you through any possible\u00a0risks and how long recuperation will take. And you should\u00a0never feel pressure to sign up for more procedures at the recommendation of the doctor, or to go with that doctor simply\u00a0because you\u2019ve had a consult. While it\u2019s normal to feel a little nervous about a procedure, you shouldn\u2019t have doubts about the professionals doing it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Choosing the right cosmetic surgeon can be intimidating.
