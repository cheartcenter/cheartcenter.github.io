Some seem more prone to it, while others manage to skate through to potty training with only a few flare ups. It\u2019s hard to keep your little one 100% diaper rash-free, but with some simple fixes you can minimize their risk. Here\u2019s how to (mostly) avoid the dreaded diaper rash, and what to do if your baby gets it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diaper rash symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s pretty easy to recognize diaper rash \u2014 your baby\u2019s red and irritated skin speaks for itself. What\u2019s not always possible, is to tell the difference between different <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">types<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A diaper rash caused by a yeast infection, for example, might look like a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash with white bumps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in it, or a red rash with scaly patches. But if you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s pretty hard to tell the difference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diaper rash causes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few different <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (also known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5014885\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper dermatitis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), but one of the most frequent culprits is moisture. Sitting in a wet diaper irritates the skin and the longer you sit, the worse the skin irritation is going to be. No matter how absorbent the diaper, after a few pees, it\u2019s not possible to keep the layer next to the baby&#8217;s skin dry. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to change your baby after every pee, but the less time they spend in a wet diaper the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poop is another story. Poop is more irritating to your baby\u2019s skin than pee and a major <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cause<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so you\u2019ll want to get them out of a poopy diaper ASAP. But even changing your baby seconds after each bowel movement (BM) doesn\u2019t protect them completely. If your little one has frequent poops or a bout of diarrhea, they\u2019ll likely get diaper rash anyways. In this case, make sure you clean them thoroughly after each BM and use a protective and healing balm or cream each time. And if your child\u2019s rash isn\u2019t going away, it\u2019s a good idea to take them to see their pediatrician. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeast<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> causes <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too \u2014\u00a0 in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfed newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s especially. And if their diaper rash is caused by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/oral-thrush-overview-symptoms-causes-treatments-maple\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thrush<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you might be passing it back and forth between you and your baby. In either case, you should speak to a doctor to figure out the best way to treat it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Food, formula and diaper rash<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Formula-fed babies are just as susceptible to moisture-induced diaper rash as breast-fed babies. But for some formula-fed babies, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can signal a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formula allergy.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In this case, diaper rash probably won\u2019t be the only tell \u2014 you\u2019ll likely spot other signs as well, like irritability after eating, loose stool or diarrhea, or even blood in their stool. If you notice any of these signs and your baby\u2019s diaper rash isn\u2019t going away, talk to their pediatrician. They should be able to confirm if it is a formula allergy or something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your baby starts solids, it\u2019s a great idea to keep a food journal. This way you can track if there are certain <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foods that cause diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your little one. Acidic foods like citrus or tomatoes are frequent triggers, but <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30488541\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food allergies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can also cause diaper rash.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diaper rash: cloth vs. disposable diapers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaper rash doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2014 both cloth and disposable diaper-clad babies get it. Cloth diapers, however, are generally less absorbent than disposables, and don\u2019t wick moisture away from your baby\u2019s skin as well. This is a great feature to encourage potty training, but less good when it comes to preventing diaper rash. To reduce your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chance of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, make sure you change them frequently. If their diaper feels heavy or it\u2019s been more than two hours, they probably need a change. As well, if you\u2019re washing your cloth diapers at home yourself, make sure you follow manufacturer guidelines for cleaning them. Cloth diapers that aren\u2019t cleaned properly or dried fully can be a breeding ground for yucky (and smelly) bacteria, which may increase their chances of developing a yeast diaper rash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disposables are more absorbent than cloth diapers but they\u2019re just as likely to cause diaper rash when left on too long. As well, disposable diapers often have a number of chemical ingredients. These chemicals (and sometimes fragrances) can also cause diaper rash or irritation in your baby. If your baby\u2019s diaper rash is spread over the entire area that the diaper covers, try switching diaper brands \u2014 something in the diaper itself could be causing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Treating diaper rash<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether your child is a toddler or a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rash<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should involve getting them out of their diaper. It\u2019s easier to have a two-year-old run around bare-bum (especially outside), but even taking a few minutes extra before putting a new diaper on your infant can help. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby diaper rash cream<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also useful, but be warned \u2014 if you use a barrier cream with zinc oxide or petroleum jelly without drying the area completely before applying it, you\u2019re actually sealing moisture against the baby&#8217;s skin. This makes their rash worse over time. Since severe <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaper rashes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bleed<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are incredibly painful, applying a balm at the first sign of redness is crucial. In some cases, like <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">severe diaper rash from diarrhea<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a medicated cream might be necessary. A good rule of thumb is if it\u2019s not getting better after three days of treatment, it\u2019s time to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diaper rash do\u2019s and don\u2019ts<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do change your baby frequently \u2014 if it\u2019s been more than two hours, they probably need a change (unless they\u2019re sleeping).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t leave your baby sitting in a poopy diaper.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do speak to your child\u2019s doctor if their rash isn\u2019t getting better after three days.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do speak to your child\u2019s doctor if they develop diaper rash with bumps, blisters or sores.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t use scented diapers or wipes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do dry your baby completely before applying a barrier cream.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do use a baby balm when you change your baby.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t use a wipe to clean your little one unless they\u2019ve pooped.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do speak to your child\u2019s doctor if they develop a fever or if their diaper rash spreads beyond the diaper area.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do wash your hands after every diaper change.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s a wide range of types of baby diaper rash \u2014 from slight redness to full-blown sores.
