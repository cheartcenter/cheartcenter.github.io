You\u2019ve probably also had tons of help planning your baby shower and picking out baby clothes. But a lot less thought goes into the postpartum period for you, the mom. We know that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lot<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can happen when you have a new baby. And if you have an OB\/GYN, your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum checkup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won\u2019t happen until six weeks after your baby is born. So here\u2019s how to prep for that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum checkup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and some of the info you\u2019ll want to know ahead of time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why do I have stomach pain after giving birth?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body isn\u2019t finished changing the minute your baby is born. Most of us know about the baby blues and the risk of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-overlooked-aspects-of-postpartum-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but you can expect some major <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/surviving-birth-what-to-expect-when-youre-postpartum\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">physical changes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. The first is that your uterus starts to shrink back to its pre-pregnancy size. This causes contractions that can feel like super painful <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum menstrual cramps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Coupled with lochia (the post-partum vaginal discharge containing mucus and blood), it may seem like you\u2019re getting your period, but you\u2019re not. Your cramps should decrease in intensity within two or thr<\/span>ee days.<\/p>\n<h2>Why does breastfeeding hurt?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breastfeeding can be hard! While some women experience some discomfort for a day or two when they first start, pain during breastfeeding isn\u2019t normal. If you\u2019ve been doing it for a few days and you\u2019re still in pain, it\u2019s a good idea to speak to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/lactation-specialist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lactation consultant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What to expect at your postpartum checkup<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for either a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postnatal doctor visit<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or one with a midwife (as long as you\u2019re a Canadian citizen). But while both provide proper postnatal care, there are some key differences. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many postnatal visits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you have, for example, depends on whether you choose an OB\/GYN (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cma.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/2019-01\/obgyn-e.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obstetrician<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\/gynecologist) or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/canadianmidwives.org\/what-midwife\/#:~:text=Midwives%20in%20Canada%20are%20autonomous,at%20least%20six%20weeks%20postpartum.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">midwife<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your labour and delivery. If you have an OB, you\u2019ll have a single visit with them in their office six weeks after your baby is born. If you\u2019re working with a midwife, however, your postpartum care will be on an ongoing basis. In Canada, most midwives come to your house within 48 hours after birth to assess the baby which gives them an opportunity to check up on you as well. Depending on your situation, you\u2019ll have around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.midwivescollective.ca\/postpartum\/#:~:text=Midwives%20make%20at%20least%20four,takes%20place%20at%20our%20clinic.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four follow-up visits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with your midwife in your home and their office before they discharge you at your six-week appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you work with an OB\/GYN or a midwife, both will take your blood pressure and ask about your physical and emotional state. They\u2019ll both ask you about your lochia to make sure it\u2019s a normal amount and colour and feel your stomach area to make sure your uterus is shrinking. You can also expect a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pelvic exam<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at your six-week checkup in both cases. This isn\u2019t as involved as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/pap-smear-purpose-procedure-results-frequency-maple\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pap smear<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 it\u2019s just to check that your reproductive organs are returning to their pre-pregnancy state. If you had stitches after labour because of tearing or an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/zx3823#:~:text=of%20the%20page-,Overview,muscles%20and%20skin%20from%20tearing.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">episiotomy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your healthcare provider can also take this opportunity to make sure you\u2019re healing properly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What to expect after your postpartum checkup<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you&#8217;ve had your six-week checkup, your midwife or your OB will discharge you back to your family doctor. But that doesn\u2019t mean your body is back to \u201cnormal.\u201d Having a baby and breastfeeding cause a range of changes is the body \u2014 everything from mood swings to vaginal <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bleeding after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six-week postpartum checkup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Your body does eventually adapt to your new role as a parent, but certain things like vaginal dryness can last for quite a while (potentially for as long as you breastfeed). Keeping hydrated and using a water-based lubricant during sex can help, but speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Postpartum checklist<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve packed your hospital bag and likely filled the closet with cute outfits for the baby, but don\u2019t forget yourself! Your postpartum body needs some TLC. Here are some great things to have on hand for the postpartum period.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpartum pads \u2014 you\u2019ll need these for about four to six weeks after the baby is born for lochia. Just make sure to stay away from pads with dry weave \u2014 they\u2019ll irritate your stitches.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A perineal spray bottle \u2014 you&#8217;ll probably get one at the hospital, but it\u2019s nice to have an extra on hand. You\u2019ll need it for cleaning your perineal area after using the bathroom.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK500986\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ibuprofen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Advil) or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK501194\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acetaminophen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Tylenol) to help deal with postpartum uterine contractions. Both are safe to take while breastfeeding.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepared meals. You\u2019ve just given birth and have a tiny human who\u2019s now dependent on you for life. The last thing you want to be thinking about is \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fruit-filled muffins and other healthy snacks. Breastfeeding can make you crazy hungry, grab-and-go snacks are a must-have.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your baby isn\u2019t the only person needing rest and care after labour and delivery. The postpartum period can be such a jarring time of transition that it\u2019s sometimes called the fourth trimester. Knowing what you\u2019re in for can help to make it a bit less difficult. So take some time to prepare and have extra support on hand in case you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lot can happen between the birth of your baby and your
