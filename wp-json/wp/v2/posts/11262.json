The current situation with COVID-19 is no different. <\/span>Recently, advice circulated saying non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like Advil could make symptoms of COVID-19 worse. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days that followed, the World Health Organization investigated the claims. Here are the facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Anti-inflammatory medication &amp; COVID-19: what\u2019s the connection?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, not everyone with COVID-19 needs hospitalization, and it\u2019s possible for many people to fully recover at home. If you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">test positive for coronavirus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your symptoms may be mild enough to manage yourself. And if that\u2019s the case, the doctor might advise that you stay in isolation to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to vulnerable people like the elderly and those with a weakened immune system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/cold-flu-allergies-or-covid-19-how-to-tell-the-difference\/\">symptoms of COVID-19<\/a> are so much like the flu, a lot of people are gravitating towards anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, the active ingredient in Advil, to help with headache, fever, and aches and pains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Symptoms of coronavirus are much like the flu, including:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">difficulty breathing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pneumonia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">headache<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sore throat<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a general feeling of being unwell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Does Advil really make COVID-19 symptoms <i>worse?<\/i><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s some truth behind the idea that taking medication to get rid of symptoms can have a small impact on your recovery time. These drugs slightly lower your body\u2019s response to an infection by reducing the warning signs that put your immune system into high gear in the first place. Those warning signs are the same things that make you feel sick, like a fever. So the choice is yours. If you\u2019re strong enough, you may consider riding out a fever without medicine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, this isn\u2019t a significant enough factor to support the claim that taking ibuprofen will aggravate COVID-19 enough to make it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worse<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There haven\u2019t been studies done to know for sure one way or another. But the general consensus in the medical community so far is that without evidence to support the theory, people should carry on using medicine like Advil as they normally would. Additionally, NSAIDS like Advil have a long history of being safely used for relief of symptoms when treating many infectious illnesses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopping these medications altogether can mean living with significant discomfort for anyone with conditions that cause chronic inflammation, so especially in that case, the advice is to continue with your regimen. If you\u2019re unsure where you stand, make sure to contact a doctor before disrupting your routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Health Organization organization <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WHO\/status\/1240409217997189128\">said on Twitter<\/a> that it does not advise against taking ibuprofen at this time.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This means they neither specifically endorse its use, nor do they think it\u2019s especially dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last word, when in doubt, Canadians can always look to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals\/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html\">Their recommendation<\/a>? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are treating coronavirus at home, <\/span>keep a fever reducing medicine like Advil or Tylenol on hand.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Monitor your fever frequently, and reconnect with medical support if you have difficulty keeping your fever under control.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How did the confusion around Advil and COVID-19 start?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The notion that ibuprofen may make coronavirus worse started when a French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/olivierveran\/status\/1238776545398923264\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> information he read in a medical journal, the Lancet, that noted a large group of patients during the pandemic\u2019s outset were all taking medication very comparable in effect on the body to ibuprofen. The theory that there is a link between the disease and the drug was mentioned, but not thoroughly explored (it\u2019s also worth mentioning that many people in this group had other health conditions too).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s so important to find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/coronavirus-get-the-truth-behind-the-rumours\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">current sources of information that you trust<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the latest on how you, your loved ones, and your community can contribute to flattening the curve.
