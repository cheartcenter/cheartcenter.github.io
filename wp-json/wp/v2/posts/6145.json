We spend so long cooped up in winter that getting outside to soak in the sunshine and warm weather is a treat.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many of us go camping or away to cottages over the warmer months. While it&#8217;s not hard to figure out how to take care of yourself in the summer, we do\u00a0need to keep some specific things in mind. Read on to take in our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health tips for summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Summer health tips for students<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, if you&#8217;re a student, you&#8217;re just like the rest of us except\u00a0\u2026 you might not have to wake up for a 9-5. While it\u2019s tempting to stay up\u00a0until all hours to enjoy those summer nights, sticking to a schedule is important for overall health and wellbeing. Many students end up working part- or full-time positions, and being overtired has some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/lack-of-sleep-side-effects\/\">not-so-great consequences<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big one is figuring out what your extended health insurance looks like once the school year is finished. Some colleges and universities extend health coverage over the summer months, but not all of them do. It\u2019s important to check into your coverage before the school year ends to make sure you know where you stand. Otherwise, you might find yourself paying even more for that dental cleaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Summer health tips for skin<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sun emits UV or ultraviolet radiation. Too much will quickly cause sunburn, and can lead to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/environment-climate-change\/services\/weather-health\/uv-index-sun-safety.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin cancer, skin aging and cataracts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To keep you updated, weather services report on the UV index \u2014 measuring our risk from zero to 11+. The sun is higher in the sky during spring and summer, so the sun\u2019s rays reach us more directly. This means that the UV index is higher \u2014 peaking between 11:00 am and 3:00 pm each day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To protect yourself, slather on the sunscreen and invest in a good hat and a pair of sunglasses with UV protection. Staying out of the sun during those peak hours is another great way to keep your eyes and skin protected. We\u2019re big fans of getting enough vitamin D and no one is suggesting you stay indoors all day, but it\u2019s important to take precautions. No one wants to look old before their time. And remember reflective surfaces like water and white sand reflect rays and increase UV exposure. So it\u2019s super important to reapply sunscreen when swimming, even if you don\u2019t feel hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Beat the heat<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While drinking more water when you&#8217;re out in the heat is a given, it\u2019s not the only thing to keep in mind. Heatstroke is actually a medical emergency. So stay vigilant on those sweltering days where the humidity bumps the temperature into the 30s. Some simple <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tips for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> keeping <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">y in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer heat<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> include making sure you wear cool, loose clothing and limiting the amount of\u00a0time you spend outdoors working or exercising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat cramps and heat exhaustion are the steps before heatstroke. So be alert for red or pale skin and nausea or dizziness after time spent in the heat. A shift in mood, a change to level of consciousness, or rapid and shallow breathing could signal <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.redcross.ca\/about-us\/media-news\/news-releases\/beat-the-heat-and-stay-safe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heatstroke<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and you should\u00a0call 9-1-1 immediately if you suspect it. Keep in mind that heatstroke can happen indoors without air conditioning, or in a car. Young children and older adults are especially vulnerable, as their bodies are not as adept at regulating their body temperature. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Water safety<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming is a great way to keep cool, but safety can&#8217;t be forgotten. R<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eading the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifesavingsociety.com\/media\/241812\/canadiandrowningreport_english_web.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Drowning Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides a window into how quickly summer fun can turn tragic. The majority of drowning deaths take place over the summer months, peaking in July. On average, over 80% of victims are male, and more than half of all drownings happen on the weekend. Recreational activities on natural bodies of water such as lakes account for many of the tragedies. But it\u2019s not young children who are drowning in these situations. Young adults aged 20-34 and seniors over 65 are the groups most likely to die from drowning in Canada. Often the victim isn\u2019t wearing a lifejacket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to water safety, small changes can have a huge impact. Lifejackets are a must for boating. And drinking and water activities should never go hand-in-hand. Weaker swimmers should also wear a lifejacket or PFD, and everyone needs to swim with at least one buddy (who can actually swim!).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bug bites<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/enjoy-outdoors-during-tick-season\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ticks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren\u2019t the only bugs that can ruin a Canadian summer \u2014 hello mosquitoes. But while Zika has gotten a lot of press in the last two years, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/west-nile-virus\/surveillance-west-nile-virus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">West Nile Virus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still a concern in parts of Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Bird baths, kiddy pools and anywhere else that water collects can make inviting spots for mama mosquito to lay her eggs, so make sure to remove all of it from your property. Even so, you\u2019re still likely to run into them. Help deter their bites by wearing insect repellent as well as loose-fitting, tightly woven fabric like nylon or polyester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer health care<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more than just making sure you\u2019re staying hydrated and eating right. As Canadians, getting out into nature is one of our national pastimes, but doing so means taking certain precautions. So take a minute to prepare before going out, to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and healthy this summer.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don&#8217;t let these
