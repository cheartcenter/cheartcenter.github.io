The truth is that about half of women have uneven breasts, known as breast asymmetry in medical terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspecting your body in the mirror, you might find that your breasts look a tad uneven. Should you be concerned for your health? The good news is that breast asymmetry is not a medical concern in the vast majority of cases. In fact, most women have some degree of breast asymmetry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While breast asymmetry is usually harmless, it can sometimes indicate a bigger problem like cancer or a developmental disorder. Pronounced breast asymmetry can also be a barrier to living a normal, confident life. So what does breast asymmetry entail, and what causes it?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is breast asymmetry?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast asymmetry is defined by differences between your breasts. There can be differences in size, shape, volume, density, or position on your chest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most women have slightly uneven breasts, but no one ever notices because the differences are minor. Breast asymmetry becomes tough to conceal when one breast is 20% greater in size than the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a large size difference can take a toll on your self-esteem. It can also indicate elevated risk for breast cancer. There are many causes for breast asymmetry, and researchers are working hard to better understand the link between embryo development, puberty, and environmental factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What causes breast asymmetry?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developmental disturbances<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your breasts and their surrounding structures start developing while you\u2019re still an embryo. If any structures are compromised during embryo development, there may be breast asymmetry later on in life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genetics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some breast abnormalities are passed down from parent to child. For example, people with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/rarediseases.info.nih.gov\/diseases\/7412\/poland-syndrome\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poland\u2019s syndrome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a rare congenital disease, may lack a pectoralis muscle on one side.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tubular breasts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tubular breasts is the name of a condition caused by breasts not developing normally during puberty. One breast may not grow at all, and instead develops a large, puffy areola. The exact cause of tubular breasts is unknown, although scientists have tentatively found <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3328117\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a link to your body\u2019s use of collagen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormones<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few types of hormonal breast asymmetry. One occurs when breasts react abnormally to hormones as you\u2019re developing through embryo, infancy, and puberty. In most cases, breast asymmetry occurs during typical hormonal fluctuations over a month or throughout your life. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During your menstrual cycle.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around menopause.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During pregnancy or breastfeeding.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When taking hormonal birth control like the pill or patch.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast asymmetry often begins in puberty and can be a difficult experience for girls navigating their early school years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a baby<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women with no prior breast asymmetry may find their breasts become uneven after going through pregnancy, birth, and lactation. This is due to loss of skin tone and elasticity, as well as hormonal changes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idiopathic factors\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idiopathic means \u201cNo one really knows.\u201d In many cases, doctors can\u2019t pinpoint an exact cause for breast asymmetry in their patients. As long as the patient is in no known medical danger, doctors treat the appearance and side-effects of breast asymmetry rather than worrying about the cause.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast asymmetry and cancer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though breast asymmetry is common, it can be a warning sign for cancer if you are a higher-risk patient. High-risk patients meet one or more of the following criteria:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal or family history of breast cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obesity and\/or a sedentary lifestyle.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-type\/breast\/risks\/?region=bc#BRCA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BRCA gene mutations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/cancer\/breast\/basic_info\/risk_factors.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> years old in age.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of hormonal therapies.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tall adult height.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study from 2015 found that women whose breasts vary in size by 20% or more may be at increased risk for breast cancer. If you have largely uneven breasts your doctor can help you create a breast examination schedule to catch any abnormalities early.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find any of these symptoms in your breasts, schedule a visit with you doctor promptly:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lump in or around your breast.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lump under your arm or in your armpit.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes in breast size or shape.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dimpled or puckered breast skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes to your nipple.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, itchy, or scaly skin on or around your breast.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discharge coming from your nipple.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast or underarm tissue that feels firm and thick.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment options for breast asymmetry<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surgery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, surgery is the only treatment option that will leave patients with evenly sized breasts. Doctors can perform many types of plastic surgeries to make breasts look equal in size and normally developed. Oftentimes doctors will only operate on one breast, reducing the invasiveness of this treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast asymmetry surgery is typically performed at plastic surgery clinics. Your health insurance may cover some or all of the procedure if it\u2019s deemed reconstructive. Provincial healthcare coverage may also pay for breast asymmetry surgery if the size difference between your breasts is large enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padded bras<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren\u2019t inclined towards surgery and your breast asymmetry is fairly minor, an adjustable padded bra might be the way to go. Some padded bras have \u201ccookies,\u201d which are removable inserts in the cup area. Adding a cookie to the side where your breast is smaller can give the appearance of even breasts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast asymmetry is a taboo topic in today\u2019s society, especially since the media projects digitally perfected, unrealistic beauty standards. Womens\u2019 bodies are each unique. Even breasts have their own individuality. The good news is that breast asymmetry is very normal. If your breasts are slightly uneven and you\u2019re in good health, there should be no cause for concern.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, breast asymmetry can be distressing if you feel like the difference is noticeable or that there might be a developing medical issue. If you\u2019d like to speak to a doctor about your breast health, you can connect with one online in minutes.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most women have some degree of breast asymmetry.
