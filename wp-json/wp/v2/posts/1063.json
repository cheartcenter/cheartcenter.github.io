You most likely called your family doctor\u2019s office to book an appointment or visited a walk-in clinic, but how long did you wait to see your doctor?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/telehealth-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadians waited seven or more days to see a family physician. Whether you belonged to this group, or were part of the 43% of Canadians who received same or next day treatment, consider the time it took\u00a0to commute to the doctor\u2019s office, and the amount of\u00a0time you spent sitting in the waiting room. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time spent waiting to see a physician typically outweighs the time spent with the physician. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting to see a doctor while congested, feverish, or in a general state of malaise is not the most comfortable activity, especially when all you want to do is recover quickly and get back to your regular\u00a0routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the story of Rosa for example<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosa, is a single working mom who, fortunately, has a very strong immune system. But one morning in early May, Rosa woke up to find herself constantly sneezing, and with a runny nose. She found her sneezing strange, but assumed that it may have been caused by the extra dust in her room and thought nothing of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As usual, she woke up her daughter, prepared a wholesome breakfast, dropped her daughter off at school, and headed to her bakery which she opened a year ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That entire morning Rosa was interrupted from her routine by sneezing spells and having to constantly blow her nose. Rosa knew she couldn\u2019t bake if this continued\u2014\u00a0it\u2019s unsanitary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She ended up googling her symptoms and was presented with a seemingly-endless list of possible\u00a0ailments, leaving her unsure of exactly what was wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a last resort, she called her\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">family doctor\u2019s office with hopes of booking an appointment for the afternoon or the next day. The receptionist told Rosa that there was no availability until the next week! She had no other choice but to take the next available slot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the rest of the week Rosa was miserable as she struggled to cope with her repetitive sneezing and a runny nose, all while trying to manage her bake<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">ry short staffed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following week Rosa took her morning off to go to her doctor appointment. She commuted for an hour to the clinic, waited for a half hour in the waiting room, and when she finally got to see her doctor, Rosa was diagnosed with seasonal allergies. Rosa was back to normal the next morning after taking her prescribed medication. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re like Rosa, who had to wait for a long period of time to see a doctor for a common medical problem, just know that you\u2019re not alone. There are many Canadians aware of the long wait times attached to seeing a doctor for minor medical concerns, a<\/span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">nd are beginning to scrap doctor visits all together.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple found that over half (68%) of Canadians skipped seeing a doctor for a variety of reasons<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common reason being the wait time to see a doctor (42%), followed by:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>37% &#8211; Cannot get a timely appointment<\/li>\n<li>17% &#8211; The doctor isn\u2019t in outside of work hours<\/li>\n<li>10% &#8211; Germ contamination in the waiting room<\/li>\n<li>10% &#8211; Physical barriers such as access to transportation or physical barriers that make it hard to see a doctor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o more skipping doctor visits!
