Here in Canada, women make about 500,000 trips the doctor\u2019s office every year due to UTIs, according to the Kidney Foundation of Canada.<\/p>\n<p>If you have ever experienced the feeling of passing sharp razor blades during urination, you are aware\u00a0of how painful a UTI can be.\u00a0The symptoms of a common infection include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased\u00a0urinary frequency<\/li>\n<li>Burning with urination<\/li>\n<li>Cloudy or foul-smelling urine<\/li>\n<li>The absence of fever or significant abdominal or back pain<\/li>\n<li>No possibility of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When it comes to uncomplicated UTIs, American Family Physician suggests <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aafp.org\/afp\/2011\/1001\/p771.html\">history is the most important tool<\/a> for diagnosis and treatment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1477561\/\">One study<\/a> has shown that patients can effectively\u00a0diagnose their own UTIs and self-initiate treatments with the same success as doctors, with doctors still playing an important management role by telephone.<\/p>\n<p>An additional\u00a0study\u00a0compared outcomes of uncomplicated bladder infections in healthy women managed by telephone versus in the office. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11485707\">conclusion <\/a>showed that short-term outcomes of managing UTIs by telephone were just as good as those managed by in person\u00a0care.<\/p>\n<p>This is why doctors can frequently and safely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/urinary-tract-infection-treatment\">treat urinary tract infections online<\/a>.This can feel like a more convenient way to deal with this extremely\u00a0common, yet uncomfortable medical issue.Typical treatment includes a short course of antibiotics like Septra or Macrobid. Additionally, The Kidney Foundation of Canada\u00a0suggests the following at-home\u00a0remedies for symptom relief:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Drink plenty of water (about six glasses per day) so that\u00a0you urinate often. Don&#8217;t try to\u00a0hold your urine once your bladder feels full, and empty your bladder completely each time you pass urine. Women prone to UTIs should urinate after having sex. Wipe yourself from front to back so that\u00a0you don&#8217;t transport bacteria from your anus to your urethra. Cut down on your caffeine and alcohol intake. If you are prone to UTIs, avoid bubble baths, bath oils, perfumed soaps and vaginal douches.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>When you need an in person\u00a0urine sample for your UTI<\/h2>\n<p>Urine samples are only recommended if there is a suspicion of a more serious kidney infection. Also, if your symptoms do not improve within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment and\/or you experience the following additional symptoms, you should\u00a0consider seeking\u00a0more urgent medical care.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood or pus in the urine<\/li>\n<li>Fever, chills or vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Diabetes or chronic illness<\/li>\n<li>A history of kidney infection or disease<\/li>\n<li>Pain or urination during pregnancy<\/li>\n<li>Bad back pain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When To Avoid The Clinic For Your UTI\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LXcmIS-dn9s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission\u00a0is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Written by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\">Dr. Brett Belchetz<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; CEO and practicing emergency room physician in Toronto, with extensive experience in both adult and paediatric medicine.
