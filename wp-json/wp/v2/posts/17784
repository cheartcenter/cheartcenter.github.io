Pollen and plants aren\u2019t the only causes of these unpleasant symptoms. Substances in your food, household, and even your soap can trigger an allergic reaction. Here\u2019s a look at some common misconceptions to do with allergies, and tips for keeping your allergies under control.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Myth \u2014 sinus rinsing is dangerous<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rinsing your stuffed-up sinuses with clean water or saline solution can relieve the discomfort of nasal congestion. There are tools you can use to flush out your sinuses, like Neti pots. They\u2019re designed to gently push mucus, allergens and debris out of your nasal passages so you can breathe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5473884\/are-neti-pots-safe\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">debate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about whether sinus rinsing is a safe practice. Complications can arise from sinus rinsing with tools that weren\u2019t properly cleaned. Dirty tools flush bacteria into the nasal passage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sinus rinsing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2778074\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">isn\u2019t dangerous<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as long as it\u2019s done with water that&#8217;s been boiled or distilled. This is necessary for cleaning any tools you insert into your nasal passage. Avoid using tap water to clean your device unless it\u2019s been boiled first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another misconception about nasal flushing is the more you do it, the better you\u2019ll feel. The truth is, sinus infections have been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/consumers\/consumer-updates\/rinsing-your-sinuses-neti-pots-safe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rinsing too often. There\u2019s no need to sinus rinse if you aren\u2019t congested. Your nose is able to clean itself naturally. If you are congested, start with rinsing once daily and see if it helps your symptoms, to a maximum of three times daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Myth \u2014 cleaning products don\u2019t cause allergies\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean environments have fewer allergens. That\u2019s why keeping your home free of dust can help keep your allergies at bay. In Canada, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/en\/pub\/82-625-x\/2018001\/article\/54983-eng.pdf?st=hHwH83GR\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">27%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of adults report being allergic to household dust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to dust, what triggers your allergies is a microscopic creature called a dust mite. They thrive in warm, humid environments, and are often found in mattresses, sheets and carpets. Although dust mites don\u2019t bite, inhaling them or touching them can cause:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Runny nose<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sneezing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itchy, watery eyes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swelling around the eyes, with irritated skin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postnasal drip<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cough<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are countless cleaning products that are great for getting rid of dust. However, what people with allergies may not know is that some cleaning products can make their allergies worse. That\u2019s because they often contain harsh chemicals. In some cases, those chemicals trigger the same symptoms as dust. Widely used chemicals known to cause allergic reactions include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ammonia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Formaldehyde<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D-limonene<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sodium lauryl sulphate<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re commonly found in household products like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furniture polish<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dish soap<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laundry detergent<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-purpose cleaner<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabric softener<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re trying to eliminate dust to alleviate your allergies, opt for gentle cleaners. There are low-chemical options you can purchase, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/life\/thegoods\/get-a-chemical-free-clean-with-these-all-natural-diy-cleaners-1.4015291\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DIY<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Myth \u2014 adults can\u2019t develop new allergies<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most allergies develop during childhood. The good news is that lots of people grow out of them. Conditions like asthma, or allergies to certain foods often disappear as your immune system matures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all allergies begin during childhood. It\u2019s possible to develop new ones later in life. This is most common with food allergies. One study found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3828364\/food-allergies-adulthood\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">45%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of adults with food allergies developed them in adulthood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In lots of allergic reactions, the particular food isn\u2019t actually the culprit. What triggers your immune system is actually an allergen that the food has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/staying-healthy\/adult-food-allergies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cross-contaminated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with. Especially for adults with pollen allergies, eating raw fruits and vegetables that still have pollen particles on them can cause allergy symptoms. This is known as oral allergy syndrome, and reactions are usually mild. Symptoms include itchiness and swelling in your mouth, tongue, nose, and throat soon after consuming the allergen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about which types of foods or cross-contaminants you\u2019re allergic to, consider an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/allergy-clinical-immunology\/\">allergy test<\/a>. Allergists can help you narrow down the cause of your reactions and give you advice for managing future episodes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Myth \u2014 pet allergies always cause acute reactions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While four-legged friends are great for your mental health, their effect on your physical health may be another story. Dog and cat allergies affect between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5809771\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10% and 20%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people worldwide, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.petsafe.net\/learn\/fur-facts.-why-am-i-allergic-to-cats-but-not-dogs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">twice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as many people are allergic to cats than dogs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergic reactions to animals can be caused by:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dander, which are pieces of microscopic skin shed from animals that have fur, hair or feathers. Inhaling dander can cause an allergic reaction, especially for people with asthma.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergens from the outdoors. If you have a pet that spends time outdoors, chances are they\u2019re tracking allergens back into your home. Grass, bushes, and other plant life can contribute to allergic reactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dust in litter boxes. Pets can kick up dust from their litter box, sending particles into the air that irritate your respiratory system.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all pet allergies are severe. You might have long-term, mild symptoms without knowing the cause. To reduce allergens from pets in your home environment, try an air purifier. High efficiency particulate air filters, or HEPA filters, can help. They filter air by forcing it through a fine mesh. The mesh catches things like hair, pet dander, dust, and other particles that make allergies worse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to allergies, it can be tough to narrow down your triggers. Keeping a clean home, using low-chemical products, and monitoring your diet are a few ways to beat unwanted reactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need help getting to the bottom of what\u2019s causing your symptoms, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/allergy-clinical-immunology\/\">speak to an allergist<\/a> from the comfort of your home. They&#8217;re doctors who specialize in allergies and immunology. Wait times are only a couple days, so allergy relief may be closer than you think!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lots of people have allergies, so naturally there are a lot of myths circulating, just like pollen in the air.
