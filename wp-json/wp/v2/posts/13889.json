When something challenging happens, feeling down for a while is part of processing the resulting emotions. But, feeling sad is different from having depression. Depression is a prolonged feeling of deep sadness accompanied by a disinterest in things that usually make you happy. When you\u2019re depressed, the sadness isn\u2019t always connected to an upsetting life event. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real or personally impactful.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you might have depression, you\u2019re not alone. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.gov.on.ca\/en\/public\/publications\/mental\/depression.aspx\">One in four Canadians <\/a>will experience a period of depression that requires treatment once in their life.The silver lining is that there are lots of ways to get help for depression. If you\u2019re wondering whether you might have depression, see if any of these warning signs sound familiar.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Trouble sleeping<\/h2>\n<p>Trouble sleeping and depression coexist in two ways. People with insomnia are much more likely to develop depression over time than people without sleep difficulties. On the other hand, trouble sleeping is a symptom of depression. Because they\u2019re so closely linked, the root cause and the symptom are hard to differentiate. Regardless of which comes first, trouble sleeping <a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/5053369\/sleep-problems-health-effects\/\">causes mood disturbances<\/a> and is a common sign of depression.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Loss of interest in things you usually like<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s normal for the things you\u2019re interested in to change over time. We all grow out of hobbies and interests. But everyone has long standing hobbies \u2014 maybe you cook or love to jog. When you stop doing those things because they don\u2019t feel good anymore, it could be a warning sign. Loss of interest stops keeps people from socializing or showing up for work. If you\u2019ve been feeling this way for two weeks or more, speak to a doctor or therapist. <\/p>\n<h2>3. Appetite changes<\/h2>\n<p>Some people with depression experience weight loss due to a lack of appetite.\u00a0 The opposite can also be true, and a person will overeat causing weight gain. If you\u2019re experiencing unexplained fluctuations in your bodyweight, consider whether the changes could be a red flag for your mental health.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Emotional outbursts<\/h2>\n<p>Sadness and melancholy are two well known aspects of depression. Studies show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/02\/04\/689747637\/if-youre-often-angry-or-irritable-you-may-be-depressed\">anger is connected to depression<\/a> too. Men are especially likely to feel moody and irritable when they\u2019re depressed. Since depression is a mood disorder, it prevents you from processing and expressing emotions in a healthy way. <\/p>\n<h2>5. Lethargy<\/h2>\n<p>Lethargy, simply put, is a lack of energy. When you\u2019re depressed, you feel lethargic even if you haven\u2019t been physically exerting yourself. Lethargy is noticeable both physically and mentally. People with depression often report:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling tired<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowed movement<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor concentration<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowed thinking<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowed speech<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6. Thoughts of death<\/h2>\n<p>When your outlook is clouded by sadness thoughts of death sometimes come up. In some severe cases, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/depression\">depression can lead to suicide.<\/a> If death or dying has been on your mind, remember that the feelings you\u2019re having are momentary. Suicide is a permanent response to a temporary problem.<\/p>\n<p>People who feel suicidal require immediate help from a therapist or care team. If you feel suicidal then reach out to a friend or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crisisservicescanada.ca\/en\/\">crisis hotline<\/a>, or present to your local hospital emergency room.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Risky behavior<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/features\/depression-and-risky-behavior#1\">Risky behavior<\/a> looks different for everyone, but the core driver is the same. It happens when you take unnecessary risks, often putting yourself in harm\u2019s way. Risky behaviours can be relieving in the moment because they provide a distraction from painful thoughts and emotions. But, the rewards are short lived, and the dangers can be great. Examples of risky behavior include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unprotected sex<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gambling<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speeding while driving<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drug or alcohol misuse<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fighting or violence<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>8. Substance misuse<\/h2>\n<p>Abusing drugs or alcohol is a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/depression\/forms-self-medication\">self-medication.<\/a> It provides a temporary escape from feelings of sadness and emptiness. Over time, excessively drinking or using drugs can actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/health-info\/mental-illness-and-addiction-index\/depression\">make mental illness worse<\/a>. Overconsumption is dangerous for both the physical and mental health of someone with depression.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Unexplained pain<\/h2>\n<p>When you feel happy, you might get butterflies in your stomach. <a href=\"https:\/\/adaa.org\/understanding-anxiety\/related-illnesses\/other-related-conditions\/chronic-pain\">Negative emotions have an effect on your physical body too.<\/a> If you\u2019ve been feeling bodily aches and pains and you\u2019re not sure why, it may be a reflection of what\u2019s going on inside your head. Mental illness translates to physical pain in lots of different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back pain<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoulder and neck tension<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migraines<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restless legs<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stomach aches<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stiff joints<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>10. Difficult life events<\/h2>\n<p>Despite our best efforts, sometimes we don\u2019t bounce back from hard times as fast as we\u2019d like. Difficult life events, like the death of a loved one or a divorce, bring up challenging emotions. If your sadness feels like it\u2019s lingering too long, you might need support. \u201cToo long\u201d is qualified as <a href=\"https:\/\/ontario.cmha.ca\/documents\/understanding-and-finding-help-for-depression\/\">more than half of each day, for over 2 weeks<\/a>. Hard times can trigger periods of depression. It\u2019s not unusual, and it\u2019s totally possible to find a treatment option that works for you.<\/p>\n<p>Are you seeing yourself in any of the above signs? Unfortunately, depression is all too common an experience for Canadians. Depression doesn\u2019t need to control your life. Support is here for you. Talking to a therapist is a huge step towards feeling like yourself once again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Depression affects millions of Canadians, but it can be hard to
