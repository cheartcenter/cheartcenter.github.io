Since then, one of the most common questions we\u2019ve received is \u201cwhen will doctors have a vaccine?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, doctors are treating COVID-19 with supportive care. That means a patient\u2019s vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, breathing function, and temperature, are monitored and stabilized. It\u2019s up to the patient\u2019s immune system to fight off the virus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s reassuring to know is that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">81% of COVID-19 cases are mild<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some people won\u2019t even know that they\u2019re sick. And this is part of the danger. It means groups of people who have a mild form of the illness can easily spread it to people who are at higher risk, like senior citizens, or people with pre-existing health conditions. That\u2019s certainly not to say that these are the only groups at risk \u2014 even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/6747664\/coronavirus-age-risk-disease-severity-covid\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">young healthy people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have ended up in hospital.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why social distancing and practicing good hygiene are so important \u2014 they\u2019re the best strategy we have to lower the number of new infections. And at this point, there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that there\u2019s an international effort underway to quickly develop a vaccine. But how long before it&#8217;s publicly available? We\u2019ve got the latest facts on the situation here.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a vaccine?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several types of vaccines, but they all work on the same basic principle. Scientists isolate a virus and make changes to it so it\u2019s no longer harmful to humans. Then, doctors administer the altered pathogen to patients. The patient\u2019s body recognizes the vaccine pathogen as foreign, and develops antibodies to neutralize the threat. If the patient is exposed to the full-fledged version of the virus later on, their body knows how to fight it off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After developing a prototype vaccine, scientists determine the right dosage to give to patients. Then, the vaccine enters <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/wellness\/preventive-care\/vaccine4.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three rounds of testing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. First, scientists test the vaccine on healthy people with low risk of complications. Then, they test the vaccine on its intended patient group, such as children in the case of the chickenpox vaccine. Finally, scientists test the vaccine on a wide range of individuals from various geographic locations and lifestyles. After all this testing is complete, the vaccine is distributed. Scientists continue to test the vaccine on an ongoing basis to ensure it\u2019s still working properly and is not causing unintentional complications.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Timeline for a COVID-19 vaccine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Health Organization estimates that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/ng-interactive\/2020\/oct\/07\/covid-vaccine-tracker-when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12-18 months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are currently 11 vaccine formulations in wide-scale efficacy trials. While 12-18 months might sound like a long time, it\u2019s actually pretty speedy for vaccine development. Most vaccines hit the market after 5-15 years of development and testing. If scientists can achieve their goal of 12 months, it will be an impressive feat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 35 companies and academic institutions are currently working on developing a COVID-19 vaccine. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization are helping to coordinate and accelerate these efforts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the novel coronavirus shares genetic similarities with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Disease) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), scientists have a head start towards a COVID-19 vaccine. They can leverage the existing body of research on previous coronaviruses to develop a vaccine faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Treatment drugs<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two drugs that have received media attention for their potential in treating COVID-19 patients. The first is Remedsivir, which is used to treat Ebola. The second, Chloroquine, is an anti-malaria drug.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chloroquine has seen modest results in helping patients with COVID-19 recover quicker by preventing the coronavirus from attaching to lung cells. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/drugs\/drug-safety-and-availability\/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or\">the FDA advises against<\/a> the use of chloroquine outside of hospital settings or clinical trials as it may cause heart rhythm problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa2007764\">Remedsivir<\/a> has been used in compassionate care, for when patients have few options left. Some patients who\u2019ve taken it have shown great recoveries. The medication works by interfering with RNA replication within the coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More testing is needed to confirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of both these drugs. In the meantime, we\u2019ve listed below the best steps to protect yourself from catching COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The best solution for now<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following community guidelines like physical distancing and frequent hand washing is the best thing you can do to stop the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/22\/health\/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to epidemiologists<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, i<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all North Americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six feet apart, the whole pandemic would sputter to a halt.
