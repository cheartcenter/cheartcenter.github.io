Not just to safeguard your sex life, but to ensure good overall health. Luckily, figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to keep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis healthy and strong<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn\u2019t that hard. Eating well, staying active and practicing safe sex and proper hygiene are the core components. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to take care of your penis, and the most common things that can go wrong with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What does a normal penis look like?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a wide range of \u201cnormal\u201d when it comes to penises. Whether circumcised or uncircumcised, penises come in all lengths, girths and colours. Many penises also have veins running through them, which can give them a bumpy or veiny appearance in certain areas. There\u2019s even variation when it comes to the directions they point in. So unless a doctor has told you otherwise, your penis is probably normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to take care of your penis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to eating well and exercising, there are a couple of crucial things every man should do to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">care<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for his <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first is to maintain a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthy penis head<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and shaft with proper hygiene. Luckily, this is easy to do by washing the area with warm water once a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other key aspect of penis health is safeguarding yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Get vaccinated against STIs such as the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and practice safe sex by using condoms with new sexual partners. And in case of a suspected <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis infection<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, seek <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> immediately. Yes, it can seem embarrassing, but most issues get worse with time, not better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Penis conditions &amp; diseases<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any sudden changes in the appearance or function of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as a change in colour or texture, or the development of a rash, for example, should be discussed with a doctor. Here are some of the most common <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis health problems and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Peyronie\u2019s disease<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This largely unknown, but surprisingly common <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penile disorder<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is thought to affect up to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5966931\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nine percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian men, usually after the age of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.urologyhealth.org\/careblog\/six-peyronies-disease-signs-that-you-shouldnt-ignore\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peyronie\u2019s disease,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the penis often becomes misshapen or bent over time, and many sufferers report feeling <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pain<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Other symptoms can include a shortening of the penis, an hourglass shape in part of the shaft, and erectile dysfunction. This is the result of a buildup of plaque inside the walls of the penis which causes scar tissue. Doctors don&#8217;t fully understand the underlying causes of Peyronie\u2019s disease however. Treatment can involve <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cua.org\/themes\/web\/assets\/files\/peyronies_disease.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">injections or surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Phimosis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phimosis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problem<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affecting <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uncircumcised <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penises. It happens when a man or a boy isn\u2019t able to pull down the foreskin covering the head of his penis. While a boy normally isn\u2019t really able to retract his foreskin until about the age of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/urology.ucsf.edu\/patient-care\/children\/phimosis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, phimosis later in life is an issue. Being unable to retract the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foreskin<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> causes <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cleaning the penis. This can result in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penile skin infections<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and even cysts. Phimosis can also make urinating or getting an erection difficult. Treatment varies from applying topical creams to daily manual retraction of the foreskin. For those experiencing chronic issues, doctors will likely recommend circumcision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Priapism<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Priapism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">type<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">erectile dysfunction<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It happens when blood gets trapped in the penis, resulting in a sustained and usually painful erection. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Priapism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be brought on by some drugs and medications, or certain underlying health conditions such as sickle cell anemia. In all cases it requires immediate medical treatment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>STIs<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sexually transmitted infections aren\u2019t always obvious. While some like herpes produce visual signs like <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blisters<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sores on<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis head<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shaft<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many don\u2019t. In those cases, signs might include pain or burning while urinating, or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itching<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you do have an obvious lesion, it can be difficult to determine whether a growth in the genital area is harmless or a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">symptom<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infected penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/genital-warts-symptoms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genital warts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, can look a lot like a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blood blister on<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So have anything out of the ordinary examined by a doctor, but try not to freak out immediately if you find something weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A torn frenulum<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frenulum is the thin string connecting the foreskin to the penis shaft. It can sometimes tear during sexual activity, which can be painful. While there\u2019s usually no reason to seek medical care for this, you\u2019ll likely want to abstain from sex until it heals. Using lubricant during sexual activity will help to limit the risk of it happening again.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Balanitis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflammation or infection of the skin on the head of the penis is called Balanitis. It can cause a white or yellow, cottage cheese-like discharge, a red <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penile rash<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the shaft and\/or head of the penis, and an itching or burning sensation. Balanitis occurs more often in uncircumcised men, but can also affect circumcised men. Luckily, the condition is usually easy to treat with over-the-counter solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Commonly asked questions<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that penis health-related questions can be embarrassing, so we\u2019ve collected some of the most common. We\u2019re answering them so you don\u2019t have to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wondering <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to decrease penis sensitivity<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re not alone! Premature ejaculation is a common concern for many men. There are a number of topical solutions that you can put on the penis before sex to decrease sensitivity. In other cases, counselling or pelvic floor exercises can be useful. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/erectile-dysfunction-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speak to a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a complete range of ideas on dealing with this.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I increase sensitivity in my penis and glans (penis head)?<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>On the flip side, a number of men struggle with how to increase their penis\u2019 sensitivity. While it\u2019s estimated that only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4816679\/\">one quarter<\/a> of men achieve orgasm regularly in their sexual encounters, some men find it difficult or impossible to achieve orgasm even with prolonged stimulation. This can be brought on by alcohol, drugs and certain medications, or the underlying cause can be psychological or physiological. Medical intervention is often necessary to figure out the root cause as this will help dictate treatment.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is there blood in my sperm? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re finding <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blood in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">semen but not<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">urine,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or in both, if it\u2019s a one-off, it\u2019s probably nothing to be scared of.

The most common causes of regular <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bloody penis discharge<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are injury to the penis or an STD, but in rare cases it can be a sign of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penile cancer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do I keep getting boners for no reason? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is pretty much a rite of passage for every teenage boy. Hormone levels are to blame, and the condition will usually get better with time. Nighttime or early morning erections are also normal regardless of age, but usually not considered an issue.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about it might be embarrassing, but penis health is too important to go unaddressed. Penis problems don\u2019t just impact your sexual and reproductive health. They can also affect your physical and mental health.
