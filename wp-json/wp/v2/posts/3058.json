We discussed some of his interests in medicine and his experience as a Maple doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why did you specialize in Emergency medicine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s interesting.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fast pace is definitely one thing. It\u2019s very much an instant gratification kind of field. I think that\u00a0few aspects in medicine give you such a quick feedback that you\u2019ve done something to change someone\u2019s life, or that you\u2019ve done something to make someone better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why did you choose to\u00a0be part of Maple?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was invited by one of my colleagues Dr. Shafik Dharamshi, who was\u00a0one of the first doctors on Maple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it\u2019s about time that we had this type of\u00a0service in Canada and Maple does it right. It has a strong focus on patient safety, and works to recruit physicians who are comfortable and eager to be part of telemedicine. When I\u2019m practicing as a physician on Maple, I feel safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why is the safe delivery of patient care important to you?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The delivery of safe medical care is essential to our platform. It inspires trust in patients and providers. A key part of delivering safe medical care is the ability of the health care provider to access records of previous patient visits on Maple. This can help inform medical decision making. For example, if a previous medication did not work for the patient\u2019s symptoms, a new one can be tried. Maple makes this easy because a Maple physician can effortlessly access previous medications prescribed on the platform. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety is also built into our triage system. Before a Maple physician sees a patient, they are able to view the person\u2019s medical complaint. For example, a 65-year-old man with chest pain and shortness of breath should be seen in an Emergency Department. A Maple physician has the option of viewing that medical complaint and re-directing the patient immediately if that is what is needed. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What other role do you have at Maple besides doing online consultations?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I help Maple in many different capacities, one of my initial roles was to help with physician recruitment (Canada wide, coast to coast). That\u2019s still my primary role. Maple has also been doing a lot of other things, like providing inpatient care in Prince Edward Island. This and other projects will hopefully make Maple a more universal platform. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passion and delivery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through his work with Maple, Dr. Bahl is achieving his goal of changing the delivery of care in the Canadian medical industry. His Maple patients enjoy his personable character and how easy it is to connect with him on the platform. \u201cPatients love the ability to see me from the comfort of their home,\u201c he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere have been times where I\u2019ve seen patients who for example suffer from agoraphobia, so they\u2019re too afraid to leave the house. For them to even see their family doctor is like climbing a mountain. I\u2019ve seen those patients [through Maple], they\u2019re able to go onto their computer to see a doctor, have a prescription delivered to their home. I mean how much more convenient can it get?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practising Emergency Medicine and working with Maple takes up most of his time. The satisfaction of knowing he is part of the new model of patient care delivery motivates him every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe power of Maple is that you\u2019re reaching out to people who otherwise would not be able to see a doctor for geographical reasons, for health reasons, for any number of reasons, and I think that\u2019s really powerful,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>About Dr. Bharat Bahl:\u00a0Dr. Bahl is a practicing emergency physician in the city of Toronto.
