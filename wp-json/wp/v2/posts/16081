Adults need around 7-9 hours of sleep each night to be fully rested. But in Canada, only <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of adults fall asleep and stay asleep without difficulty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s normal to wake up once or twice during the night, but if you can\u2019t fall back asleep then you might have an underlying health issue. Here are some common reasons for waking up at night, and how to combat them.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep apnea<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who have sleep apnea repeatedly stop breathing while they\u2019re asleep. There are different types of sleep apnea, with obstructive sleep apnea being the most common. With obstructive sleep apnea, the soft tissue in your mouth and throat become so relaxed during sleep that they block your airways. The result is snorting, coughing or gasping for breath, causing you to wake up in the night. A few ways to alleviate sleep apnea are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight loss. People who are overweight sometimes have extra tissue around their face and throat, which puts more pressure on their airways.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding sleeping pills, sedatives, or anything that further relaxes your muscles while you sleep.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks. They pump a continual flow of oxygen into your airways while you sleep. The positive pressure keeps your airways from collapsing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re consistently stressed in the daytime, you probably go to bed stressed too. It\u2019s normal to have this happen once in a while. But if your worries frequently cause you to wake up at night, there will eventually be negative health effects. Trouble staying asleep and waking up panicked are both signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). People with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.anxietycanada.com\/disorders\/generalized-anxiety-disorder\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GAD<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have persistent, excessively worried thoughts. And since your brain still processes emotions and feelings while you\u2019re sleeping, anxiety at night can wake you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\">Talking to a therapist<\/a> helps relieve anxiety. With support, you can find coping strategies to minimize your worry and get more satisfying sleep. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ageing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not uncommon for your quality sleep to change as you get older. Sometimes that means falling asleep earlier, waking up earlier, or waking in the middle of the night. Ageing impacts your circadian rhythm, your body\u2019s internal clock. Your circadian rhythm regulates your cycles of sleeping and waking. Older adults commonly experience an advanced sleep phase, causing them to fall asleep early. Falling asleep early leads to waking up early, which could make you feel tired in the daytime. One <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cgatoolkit.ca\/Uploads\/Documents\/INSOMNIA%20IN%20THE%20ELDERLY-UPDATE%20ON%20ASSESSMENT%20AND%20MANAGEMENT.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that 40% of people surveyed over age 65 have a sleep-wake disorder like insomnia that causes them to wake up at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ways to rebalance your circadian rhythm include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding naps.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going to sleep and waking up at the same time whenever possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding smoking, caffeine, and drinking alcohol.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding food too close to bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cigarettes cause damage to your airways and lungs, which can result in breathing difficulties. This can exacerbate existing conditions like sleep apnea. Nicotine from cigarettes could also be keeping you up at night. It\u2019s the ingredient in cigarettes that creates a feeling of euphoria. Nicotine is also a stimulant, so smoking before going to bed can stop you from getting a deep sleep. When you sleep lightly it\u2019s easier to be woken up in the night by stimuli like light or noise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting smoking can be tough, but it\u2019s possible with the right support. There are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/smoking-tobacco\/quit-smoking\/tips-help-someone-quit-smoking\/you-can-quit-smoking-we-can-help.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">programs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> available to anyone that wants to try. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormonal changes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormones and sleep have a tricky relationship. Hormone imbalances can cause sleep disruption, but poor sleep can also trigger hormone imbalance. While it can be hard to know which came first, your age is a clue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In women, menopause causes a fluctuation in hormones, triggering symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. The discomfort makes it hard to sleep through the night. In men, testosterone production decreases with age. Low testosterone <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3955336\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lower energy levels, so men might nap more or decrease their physical activity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormone replacement therapy, exercise, and diet adjustments are all options to help rebalance hormone levels so you can get back to restful sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screen time<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electronic devices emit a blue light that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/articles\/screen-time-and-insomnia-what-it-means-teens#:~:text=Electronic%20devices%20emit%20an%20artificial,to%20sleep%20and%20wake%20up.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suppresses the release<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that\u2019s essential for regulating your sleep-wake cycle. When you look at screens before bed, there\u2019s a delay in your brain\u2019s release of melatonin. The result? Endless tossing and turning, wondering why you can\u2019t get to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try setting up a nighttime routine that gives you a break from screens before bed. Reading a book or practicing breathing exercises will help your brain wind down more effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re asleep, your body is busy completing essential processes for keeping you in good health. Waking up in the night interrupts that work. It\u2019s also frustrating to wake up all the time, with the side-effect of daytime fatigue. Getting to the root of what\u2019s waking you up at night is the first step towards getting a full night\u2019s sleep back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re finding yourself unable to get the rest you need, our sleep therapists can help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Regularly waking up in the middle of the night leads to daytime fatigue.
