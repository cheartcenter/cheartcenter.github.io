A lot of research goes into finding an answer. Not long ago, the popular opinion was that acne was caused by eating junk foods like french fries and chocolate bars. Now we know that the link between eating those foods and acne <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.acneaction.ca\/lifestyle\/acne-and-diet\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn\u2019t hold up scientifically<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We do know that some foods are good for your skin. There are healthy fats like the ones found in fish that contribute to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/adult-health\/expert-answers\/healthy-skin\/faq-20058184\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin health<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As for which foods lead to breakouts? Doctors and scientists are still narrowing down which foods make acne worse, and how exactly it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why when it comes to dairy, there are no straightforward answers to whether or not it\u2019s bad for your skin. Dairy is an official food group, so it can\u2019t really be bad for your skin\u2019s health, right? Studies show that the answer is different depending on your body\u2019s chemistry, and the sources you get your dairy from. Here are a few theories around dairy\u2019s influence on acne.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does acne start?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne has several root causes. If your parents had acne, you\u2019re at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathway.com\/blog\/is-acne-genetic\/#:~:text=While%20there%20isn't%20a,acne%2Drelated%20bacteria%20to%20hormones.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for having it too. Hormones also play a big role in skin health. Hormonal fluctuations can trigger outbreaks, which is why pimples are common in your teenage years. That said, plenty of adults get acne too. Nearly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dermatology.ca\/public-patients\/skin\/acne\/#:~:text=Acne%20affects%205.6%20million%20Canadians,adults%20ages%2020%20to%2040.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 million people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across Canada have acne, and 20-30% are in their 20s or 30s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Dairy and hormones<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your skin naturally produces oil. It\u2019s called sebum, and it\u2019s what upholds your skin\u2019s moisture barrier. When it comes to sebum, it\u2019s possible to have too much of a good thing. Overactive sebaceous glands, where sebum is produced, create oily skin. When that oil mixes with bacteria and dead skin cells, pores clog and pimples form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Androgens are a hormone group that affect your skin\u2019s sebum production. Testosterone is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/does-drinking-milk-cause-acne-15684\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">androgen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it\u2019s found in milk. This is one of the connections between dairy and acne. If you eat dairy frequently, the testosterone you\u2019re ingesting could be sending your sebum production into overdrive. This creates conditions for acne to easily spread.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another hormone in milk is the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBST). Like other mammals, cows produce milk to feed their young. The rBST growth hormone in a female cow\u2019s milk helps her offspring grow quickly in their early years. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/modernfarmer.com\/2014\/03\/real-talk-milk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on farming practices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, mother cows are given more growth hormones that stimulate their milk production. So when you drink milk, you\u2019re drinking the growth hormone too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When growth hormone levels are off balance in your body, the resulting uptick in oil production is bad news for your pores. Drinking organic, small batch, or non-dairy dairy milk is one way to avoid consuming milk from high production dairy cows that may have been given hormones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Not all dairy is created equal<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/10\/8\/1049\/htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on subjects between age seven and 30 years old showed that regardless of how much dairy participants consumed, their likelihood of having acne always increased. This was especially true in subjects that drank one glass of milk or more per day. If you\u2019re prone to acne and looking for ways to minimize outbreaks, eating less dairy is worth a try.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study also found that some dairy products are more likely to contribute to acne breakouts. The difference has to do with how the dairy ranks on the glycemic index. The glycemic index ranges from 1 to 100. It measures how quickly glucose levels in your bloodstream increase after you consume a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/diseases-and-conditions\/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particular food<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Foods that are high in glucose cause a spike in blood glucose levels. To bring its blood glucose level back down to normal, your body produces insulin. Insulin is another androgen hormone. Just like testosterone, a sudden surge in insulin increases your skin\u2019s oil production. That\u2019s how foods with high glucose levels contribute to acne.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonfat milk ranks higher than full fat milk on the glycemic index at 41\/100. For perspective, chocolate\u2019s score on the glycemic index is 43. Yogurt scores the same. So if you\u2019re drinking milk every day, especially in combination with carbohydrates like cereal, you\u2019re sending your blood glucose levels for a ride. Sticking to foods lower on the glycemic index helps to keep your body\u2019s oil production under control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t mean you have to avoid all dairy. Cheese is a tasty dairy product that has a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/317222#:~:text=Cheese%20has%20a%20low%20glycemic,these%20may%20spike%20blood%20glucose.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> low glycemic index<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you\u2019re unsure, take a look at the nutrition label on your favourite dairy products. The higher the number of carbohydrate grams, the higher the chance that the food will trigger an insulin spike.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The final verdict<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While more research needs to be done before we can say conclusively that dairy causes acne, we do have some clues. Because androgens in milk products increase your skin\u2019s oil production, there\u2019s evidence linking dairy to breakouts. Of course, there are plenty of people who consume no dairy at all but still have breakouts. Until more studies are available, enjoying dairy in moderation is a safe bet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re dealing with acne, our dermatologists can help you understand the way your diet is affecting your skin\u2019s health. There\u2019s a lot of information out there, but speaking to a specialist can take the guesswork out of planning a healthy skin routine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People often wonder whether dairy causes acne.
