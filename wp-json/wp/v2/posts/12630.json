After all, employee wellness is simply another term for human wellness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a collective society, we\u2019ve gone to great lengths to protect the health and safety of our most vulnerable community members. Amidst all of this, we\u2019re still going to work. Your employees are withstanding a global pandemic, civil unrest, isolation at home, and are still showing up with a smile for the Monday morning meeting.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your staff is putting on a cheery face, make no mistake \u2014 today\u2019s conditions are still causing a strain on their mental and physical health. Employers need to give back to their staff\u2019s health and wellness, especially in these trying times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalwellnessday.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Wellness Day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on June 13, 2020, we\u2019ve put together seven initiatives you can undertake to create a culture of physical and mental wellness at your company. But first, how does it benefit employers to boost the health of their workforce?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of a happy and healthy workforce<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A healthy workforce is a productive workforce. The average employee takes 8.1 sick days per year, which costs their employer around $2,000.<\/span><sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s not even accounting for losses in productivity due to uncomfortable symptoms.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good health benefits program gives employees one less thing to worry about, which helps them focus on putting their best efforts forward at work. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubinternational.com\/press-releases\/2017\/07\/hub-international-releases-findings-of-second-annual-benefits-barometer-study\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54% of benefits professionals<\/span> <\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cite employee morale as their most improved metric from implementing wellness programs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to attract new talent is through word of mouth from your own employees. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2016\/06\/workplace-well-being\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">89% of workers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at companies that support well-being efforts are more likely to recommend their company as a good place to work.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this Global Wellness Day, try out some of the suggestions below to build a happier, healthier culture at your workplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Encourage physical activity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best things employees can do to decompress is to move their body in whatever way they find enjoyable. Exercise is naturally mood boosting as it releases serotonin, the \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical, in the brain. Good fitness also helps prevent repetitive strain injuries, and boosts core strength that\u2019s needed to comfortably sit at a desk all day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you incorporate physical activity into your employees work days? Make it part of the daily schedule. Have a group hangout at lunch, and invite a fitness instructor to lead an exercise class. Make sure to make it approachable for all fitness levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To promote exercise as a lifestyle habit, offer discounted memberships to local gyms, or online fitness classes. Right now, COVID-19 has caused gyms to shut down their facilities, but many are now offering online classes. Check out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yyoga.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yyoga<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for great yoga classes for strength, flexibility, and relaxation led by some of Canada\u2019s best instructors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Create opportunities for social connection<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest drawbacks of working from home, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/business\/working-at-home-isolation-1.5103498\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadians are reporting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is feelings of loneliness. Many people get a huge social benefit from seeing their co-workers at the office, and building something meaningful together. Try to make the mantra \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/26\/well\/live\/being-together-while-staying-apart.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">united by staying apart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d come alive at your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have regular online social nights or lunches where employees of all departments can have some facetime, unwind, and chat about topics other than work. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeout.com\/usa\/things-to-do\/online-party-games-to-play-with-friends-remotely\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of icebreaker games<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can use to cut through any awkwardness of video calls.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to foster social connection is to set up a buddy or mentor system. The buddy system is great for helping new employees feel welcomed, and learn their way around your company\u2019s processes quicker. And mentorship benefits both the mentor and the mentee. The mentee will receive career guidance, which gives them a sense of progress despite these tumultuous times. As for the mentor, senior professionals who choose to mentor gain leadership skills and expand their network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Provide mental health supports<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A remarkable <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/press.careerbuilder.com\/2017-05-23-Do-American-Workers-Need-a-Vacation-New-CareerBuilder-Data-Shows-Majority-Are-Burned-Out-at-Work-While-Some-Are-Highly-Stressed-or-Both\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61% of employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are reported to be burnt out on the job. That figure has likely risen given recent world events, and the challenge of adapting to new modes of life and work. And, in any given year <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/fast-facts-about-mental-illness#:~:text=In%20any%20given%20year%2C%201,some%20time%20in%20their%20lives.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five Canadians<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will experience a mental health problem or illness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all goes to show how common mental health struggles are. Employees who are grappling with a mental illness <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/documents\/mental-illnesses-in-the-workplace#:~:text=How%20do%20mental%20illnesses%20impact,may%20feed%20much%20bigger%20thoughts.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may appear withdrawn, take lots of time off, or appear less productive than usual<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some steps you can take to alleviate mental stress on your employees:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include psychotherapy in your employee benefits packages. Virtual therapy is growing in popularity because patients can book according to their schedule, and receive their session at home. For people who lead busy lives, or are hesitant to venture to a therapist\u2019s clinic, virtual therapy makes mental health care that much more accessible.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have organized internal processes so that employees can work towards clear expectations, and aren\u2019t overwhelmed by incoming tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give out mindfulness resources. Things like meditation app subscriptions, tips sheets, and comfortable, quiet office spaces can go a long way.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train managers on basic mental health protocols. Every employee is different, and some will need more support than others.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage work-life balance. This will allow for fully refreshed employees at the start of every workday, who can bring their most creative ideas to the table.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. State your values loud and proud<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, companies can\u2019t afford to be silent on where they stand when it comes to social responsibility. Employees, and customers, are choosing to put their time and money towards companies who look out for their local and global communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees are more engaged when they\u2019re working for organizations that talk the talk, and walk the walk. Proclaiming your company values on topics like environmentalism, gender, and racial equality also promote a culture of inclusivity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Have an open dialogue\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effectiveness of psychotherapy proves that talking out your problems goes a long way in solving them. Having an honest, transparent culture at your workplace is huge for reducing stress on your employees, and boosting feelings of empowerment and connectedness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your employees know you have a policy of open communication. Schedule regular one-on-one meetings between junior employees and management so that there\u2019s both top down and bottom up feedback.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, employees are probably wondering what future office life will look like after COVID-19. The best thing to do is be transparent, and communicate new office policies well before employees return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let employees know of new office cleaning measures, hygiene rules, office adjustments, policies around business travel, and what will happen if a colleague tests positive for COVID-19. For more advice around reopening your office safely, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/six-tips-for-bringing-your-staff-back-to-the-office-safely\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check out our article here.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Perform a health and wellness audit<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of things can be revealed in a thorough audit. If you\u2019re really invested in knowing your employee wellness score, do an audit on multiple fronts. Here\u2019s a basic checklist to get you started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General satisfaction levels around office culture.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexibility in working arrangements, such as work from home.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adequate healthy nutritional options provided.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office health and safety protocols.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Company stance on drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parental accommodations, such as maternity leave, or flexibility in leaving work early to pick up kids from daycare.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poll your staff on the above items, and any other points that might be relevant for your company. If the resulting score is low in a particular area, that shows you where to investigate and improve.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Create a stand-out benefits program<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For top talent, companies that offer robust benefits packages really stand out as an employer of choice. 76% of Canadians would not move to a job that didn\u2019t offer a strong benefits package.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at your benefits program and see if there are any areas that could be bolstered. Extended dental, bodywork, and virtual care are all great additions. The healthier your employees are, the greater they\u2019ll thrive at work, which will lead to some amazing results on the business side.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Wellness Day means something different this year: a day to appreciate our own unique wellness journeys, a time to reflect on how we\u2019re persevering through some exceptional circumstances, and an opportunity to examine how to best support your employees.
