Most newborns will nod off just about anywhere, so it\u2019s usually pretty easy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/babys-sleep-schedule\/\">get them to sleep<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But thanks to something known as the startle reflex, keeping them asleep is another story. Learning a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddling technique<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or two can help but the topic has become controversial in the last few years. Read on for the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pros and cons<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddling a baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how long<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do it for and how to know <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to stop swaddling<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your little one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why swaddle?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefit of swaddling a newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to increase the length of time that they\u2019ll sleep for. So if you\u2019re wondering \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should I swaddle my newborn at night<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u201d the answer might be yes. As mentioned, newborns have a startle reflex called the \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK542173\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moro reflex<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d which scientists think might be left over from when our ancestors lived in trees and babies slept clinging to their mothers. This reflex causes babies to throw their arms out and a loud noise or sudden touch can set it off. So can lowering your baby into their bassinet, which is why it can really mess with their sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swaddling a baby keeps their arms close to their body and makes the Moro reflex less likely to wake them up. It might also help them to feel secure like when they were snug and cozy in the womb. Whatever the reason, swaddling seems to work well with some babies. Not all babies love the swaddle though. For those that seem to hate it, some parents report it\u2019s worth it to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to swaddle a baby with<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arms out.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This way, they benefit from the comfort of being wrapped up without having their arms restricted. Others find that swaddling isn\u2019t for their little one at all, and that\u2019s ok too. There\u2019s no need to swaddle your child if they\u2019re not into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is swaddling safe?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practice of swaddling is controversial in Canada. The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) states that there is no safe way to swaddle a baby and several provincial health services disavow swaddling a baby for sleeping \u2014 instead stating that it should be done to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/health\/documents\/swaddling.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calm them before sleep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you do choose to swaddle your baby, make sure that the swaddle doesn&#8217;t cover their head or neck. Babies should also be dressed in light clothing as hyperthermia (overheating) is a real concern. The swaddle should also be loose enough around the baby\u2019s legs and hips that they have no trouble bending, stretching or moving their legs a little as hip dysplasia is also a risk of swaddling. One of the major concerns, however, begins the minute your little one starts trying to roll \u2014 at around two months. A swaddled baby who rolls over can\u2019t roll themselves back, potentially putting them at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/causes-of-sids\/\">risk of suffocation<\/a>. So as much as you might not want to give it up, developing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddling techniques for an older baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a bad idea.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative to swaddling<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a sleep sack or wearable blanket. There are also a number of transitional swaddle products on the market. These adapt as your baby grows to help acclimatize them to sleeping with a less restrictive swaddle wrap gradually. They\u2019re also great if you\u2019re unsure whether your baby prefers being <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddled<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arms up or down<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 some babies prefer to suck on their hands for instance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to swaddle a baby step by step<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, you don\u2019t need a manual to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to use swaddle blankets<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To start, lay your blanket out in a diamond shape and fold it in half so you end up with an upside down triangle. Lie your baby on the blanket with their feet at the bottom point of the triangle. Make sure their head is off the blanket, but that their shoulders are on the blanket and their arms are down by their sides. Bring the right side of the blanket all the way across the baby and tuck it under their right arm. Then fold the bottom of the blanket up over your baby\u2019s feet. Finally, fold the left side of the blanket across the baby&#8217;s chest and tuck the end of it underneath your baby. Make sure that the baby&#8217;s head and neck are free of the blanket and that the swaddle is snug but not tight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re having trouble getting your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddling technique<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> down, a swaddle wrap is a nice, less complicated alternative. And they usually involve velcro so they\u2019re less likely to come undone, which is a great bonus. As with a swaddle blanket, make sure the swaddle wrap isn\u2019t covering your baby\u2019s airway and your baby isn\u2019t starting to roll yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as you know <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when to stop, swaddling<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your baby may be a great way to help them sleep longer. If you\u2019re having trouble getting your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swaddle technique<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> down, there are a number of instructional videos out there. And you can always use a specialized swaddle wrap if all that folding is too much to handle. Now if only there was a product you could buy to get them to sleep through the night.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swaddling is controversial and experts point out that it can be dangerous, but some parents still choose to swaddle their infants.
