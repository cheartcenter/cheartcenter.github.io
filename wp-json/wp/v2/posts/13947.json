Awareness of postpartum depression and the difficulties new moms face has grown over the last few years. But there are aspects of the condition that still aren\u2019t widely known. We\u2019re taking a look to see who\u2019s at risk for postpartum depression, and some new research on one of its often overlooked indicators.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is postpartum depression?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most postpartum women experience something called the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tn7417\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby blues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is a period of low mood following the birth of their child. But the baby blues tend to resolve within a couple of days, or at maximum two weeks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (PPD) is any depression that a parent (usually the mother) experiences in the first year after her child is born. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> manifest <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after pregnancy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, though for some they begin before the birth of the child \u2014 this is known as perinatal depression.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new baby often changes both a parent\u2019s sense of self and the relationship dynamics of a couple. Because of this, PPD doesn\u2019t just affect biological mothers <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after birth \u2014 symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are well documented in adoptive parents too (usually called post-adoption depression). PPD can also affect mothers who have had a miscarriage or a stillbirth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of postpartum depression<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Canada, obstetricians, midwives and even some pediatricians screen postpartum women for symptoms of PPD.

In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/daily-quotidien\/190624\/dq190624b-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian women report feelings of depression or anxiety during the postpartum period \u2014 that\u2019s almost one in four new moms. Lack of sleep is a major trigger for the disorder, and women who rate their sleep quality as poor after their child is born are more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5322694\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as likely to develop PPD than other new parents.

Many couples where one partner struggles with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also report <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marriage problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Unchecked depression can get worse and become chronic so seeking treatment is crucial. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment for postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can take many forms \u2014 from having your co-parent share more responsibilities (like baby\u2019s night wakings) to taking medication. Speaking to a friend or family member and seeking out other new parents to share your experience with is often helpful as well. And many women report that seeing a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">therapist<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> symptoms provides relief. Depression can be brought on by both biological and social factors, so it helps to have a multifaceted treatment approach.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first year after a child is born brings many changes \u2014 physically, hormonally, emotionally and socially. Lack of sleep, little time for self-care, and the social isolation that many new parents feel can all contribute to depression. Because having a child is such a profoundly life changing event, parents can sometimes dismiss feelings of depression as being related to their new life and all that comes with it. But postpartum depression is real and can happen to anyone. If you\u2019re concerned that you or your partner has <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum depression<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, speak to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psychotherapist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your doctor, your friends and loved ones.
