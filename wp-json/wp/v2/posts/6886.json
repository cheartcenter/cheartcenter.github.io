While we often point the finger at &#8220;grown-up problems&#8221; like bills or a finicky boss,\u00a0Statistics Canada reports that almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/t1\/tbl1\/en\/tv.action?pid=1310009604\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of teenagers are also stressed out. And <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipsos.com\/en-ca\/stress-becoming-way-life-canadians\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">63 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of us feel just as or more stressed than we did five years ago. Stress has major health repercussions, so given that it&#8217;s become a way of life for us, self-care strategies need to feature just as prominently in our lives. Read on to learn more about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stress and easy self-care strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is self-care?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s start by tackling the biggest self-care myth. Many think self-care means a standing manicure appointment or a week at a five-star resort and spa. While both are nice, self-care doesn\u2019t have to be fancy or expensive. Self-care is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 taking care of yourself. It means staying healthy and giving yourself an opportunity to rest and recharge when needed. It can be as simple as a five-minute shower or saying &#8220;no&#8221; to adding one more task to your to-do list.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of self-care strategies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress can do all sorts of nasty things to our bodies, from causing digestive difficulties to weakening our immune systems to causing migraines. Over time, chronic stress can even change our brain and result in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Depression-treatment\">depression<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/anxiety-treatment\/\">anxiety<\/a>. Possible physical consequences can include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/heart-health-tips\/\">cardiovascular issues<\/a>, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5137920\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">autoimmune diseases and even cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ensuring that you have simple self-care <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategies to reduce stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your life is key. Deep breathing on its own, for example, has the potential to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5455070\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decrease levels of cortisol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 AKA the stress hormone. Having tools and strategies like these to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> de-stress yourself instantly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a big help for day to day life, and also increase alertness and improve mood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-care tips for caregivers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most Canadians admit to feeling stress, there are certain groups\u00a0at elevated risk for it. Caring for others can be hugely rewarding. It can also be physically exhausting and emotionally draining. Looking after a parent or loved one with disabilities or physical frailties can be both overwhelming and isolating. Without the opportunity to rest and recharge, many experience <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caregiver stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Constant strain from making sure you&#8217;re always available and focusing on another person wears on you. Caregivers experience much <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.womenshealth.gov\/files\/documents\/fact-sheet-caregiver-stress.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher levels of stress<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the general population, which affects their health in myriad ways. It can feel impossible to eat a full meal, let alone take a break, but <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-care<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is crucial <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for caregivers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For caregivers, the single best thing you can do for yourself is to get help. If you don\u2019t have friends or family to share the work, many communities have respite programs to help ease stress by taking care of your loved ones for a short period of time. Lowering your standards might also have to be a part of the new reality \u2014 if you\u2019re super neat and feel compelled to vacuum multiple times a week, you might have to cut back, and that&#8217;s ok! Especially if it frees up time for you to search for other resources to help you day-to-day \u2014 Meals on Wheels for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-care tips for parents<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to reason with a two-year-old requires reserves of patience. It can feel like there\u2019s never a time when you\u2019re not picking up, carrying, holding or being touched by their little hands. Even when they\u2019re sleeping (if they do), it can feel like there\u2019s a never-ending list of chores to do. And for the older kids, there&#8217;s a whole other level of commitment from getting involved in their school to taking them to piano\u00a0or soccer (or both!) It\u2019s enough to make even a Mother Teresa-type frustrated. Sometimes it feels like the only way to survive is to put your head down and just push through. But this period involves years of your life \u2014 you need to feel like\u00a0you\u2019re doing more than just surviving. Self-care can restore a sense of calm, and maybe even a sense of self.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents, like other caregivers, benefit from breaks. You might also feel isolated as a parent, especially if you are at home with your little one alone. Seeking out\u00a0other parents can be a great source of connection, information and emotional support. Most communities offer free drop-in programs for children throughout the week. Your local library is usually a good place to start. If that\u2019s not an option for you, online communities can be an invaluable resource for connecting with others experiencing similar situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-care strategies for stress<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a break \u2014 figure out what you have time for. It can be as simple as taking a five-minute shower or as fancy as booking an afternoon at the spa, but time to yourself is golden.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask for help and be specific \u2014 if your sister-in-law is coming by to visit the new baby, don\u2019t be shy about asking her to pick up some diapers on her way, and don&#8217;t feel &#8220;bossy&#8221; for telling her which size and brand you use.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to eat regular meals \u2014 sneaking a spoonful of peanut butter while you multitask doesn\u2019t count. Don\u2019t neglect your own nutrition.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say \u201cno\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more often. You have enough on your plate without feeling like you have to bake three different things for your neighbour\u2019s cookie exchange. Feel free to tell them you\u2019re busy \u2014 even if you\u2019re not.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to get regular exercise. This can feel like an impossible goal when you have so much going on, but even an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/mind-and-mood\/more-evidence-that-exercise-can-boost-mood\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hour of active housework<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a day can boost your mood.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try some short breathing or meditation exercises \u2014 they\u2019re great for de-stressing in the moment and\u00a0over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that if your airplane is going down you put your oxygen mask on before helping others.
