But with other parents and social media touting home-made, free-range, all-natural and organic food for their little ones, it can also feel like A LOT of pressure. On top of that, knowing when, how much and what to feed your little one can be confusing \u2014 even your mom doesn\u2019t have all the answers (just because she gave you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rice cereal at 3 months<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doesn\u2019t mean you should do the same). And while some <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solid food charts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be helpful, they can also induce anxiety \u2014 especially if your baby won\u2019t eat certain foods (or not enough, or too much). The good news is that feeding your baby solid food is a lot less complex than it seems. Whether you choose purees or baby-led weaning (BLW), here are the rules for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing food<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do I know it\u2019s time to introduce solid food?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is going to tell you. You\u2019ll know you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should start<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby on solids when<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they can sit up on their own and seem interested in what you\u2019re eating. If they\u2019re reaching, chewing or staring intensely at you during meals, they\u2019re probably signaling they\u2019d like a taste. This usually happens <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/feeding_your_baby_in_the_first_year#:~:text=Introducing%20solid%20foods,well%20into%20the%20toddler%20years.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but you\u2019re probably fine if you want to start a bit earlier \u2014 as long as it\u2019s not before four months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What about allergies?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing solid food<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, most doctors recommend adding a new food every three days. That way if there\u2019s an allergic reaction, you\u2019re much more likely to know the cause of it. Children don\u2019t typically have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/allergies-in-babies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergic reactions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the first time they have a new substance. If you have food allergies, however, it\u2019s a good idea to speak to your child\u2019s doctor before introducing those foods to your little one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What foods do you introduce to babies first?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast milk or infant formula should be your baby&#8217;s primary source of nutrition for their first year. But unless your doctor has told you otherwise, you can start adding fruits and veggies to your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s diet after six months<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There\u2019s no need to follow a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">month-by-month baby solid food feeding guide <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as up until they turn one, food is just for fun!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides breastmilk or formula, there are, however, a couple of musts for your little one\u2019s diet. Your baby needs vitamin D drops every day \u2014 actually, as Canadians most of us should be taking <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/osteoporosis.ca\/bone-health-osteoporosis\/calcium-and-vitamin-d\/vitamin-d\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vitamin D every day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Iron-rich foods should also be on the menu, especially if your child is breastfed and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/iron_needs_of_babies_and_children#:~:text=Iron%20is%20a%20mineral%20that,red%20blood%20cells%20their%20colour.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">older than six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Most baby cereals are iron-fortified, so double check the back of the package to see if it meets their nutritional requirements. If not, meat, fish, eggs and beans are your best bets. You may think it sounds gross, but chances are your baby will love their pureed meat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>First year feeding guide<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to introducing specific foods to baby, there are very few hard and fast rules for their first year. The major one is not to give honey until your child is at least one as it can cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/food-safety-vulnerable-populations\/infant-botulism.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">botulism<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s also a good idea to alternate between orange and other coloured foods to avoid turning your baby orange (yes it\u2019s a real thing, it\u2019s called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2280429\/?page=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carotenemia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). That and you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re feeding enough fibre (that means lots of fruits, veggies and beans) or you risk having a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/constipation-in-babies-and-infants\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">constipated baby<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Food safety<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from washing both your hands and baby\u2019s before preparing food and eating, eating safely means never leaving your baby alone in their high chair or while they\u2019re eating. Eating in their stroller or car seat is also a no-go, even more so if they\u2019re facing away from you \u2014 just because they\u2019re close to you doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t choke. If possible, it\u2019s a great idea for you, your partner and anyone else who\u2019s going to be watching the baby to take a first aid course to learn how to deal with choking. There are a number of courses available online if you can\u2019t make it in person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a parent, you\u2019re constantly bombarded with messages about what you \u201cshould\u201d be doing. You can end up feeling like your worth as a human being is tied to your child, especially when it comes to what they\u2019re eating. But at the end of the day, you only have control over what you serve and when. Your child isn\u2019t going to like every food and they might decide to eat mostly fruit for their first three years of life. That\u2019s probably ok. Speak to your child\u2019s doctor if you have concerns. But know that your baby will eventually learn to eat a wide range of foods. It just might take a while.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guidelines on introducing food to your baby have changed a ton over the last decades.
