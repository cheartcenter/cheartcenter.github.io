If these are the ratios for the entire labour market, you can imagine the disparity of women in the technology sector. Women in Communications and Technology (WCT) reports that in 2017, only 26.7% of women were represented in all of Canada\u2019s information and communications technology industry (ICT).<\/p>\n<p>According to #MoveTheDial, this number shrinks further when you look to the top-end of the tech sector:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>6% of tech companies have a female CEO<\/li>\n<li>13% of the average tech company\u2019s executive team are women<\/li>\n<li>8% of directors on boards of Canadian tech companies are women<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maple is different. 70% of our employees are women, which makes us an outlier in the tech industry. With a female co-founder and COO and a 63% female executive team we\u2019re representing women at every level of the business, and turning the gender gap on its head.<\/p>\n<p>In celebration of Women\u2019s Equality Day, we\u2019re highlighting the experience and advice of the inspiring women working at Maple.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/roxana-zaman-464a9b21\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3B19zu5z1lTdCN3P930h%2BhVA%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=H84lcmUcSKKujXhuJWmyTg%3D%3D\">Roxana Zaman<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Co-founder &amp; COO<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI never intended to enter the tech industry. It just sort of happened. My academic background is in finance and economics, and I joined the corporate banking world right after graduating university. Working in tech isn\u2019t really all that different. Aside from the technology itself, my work is about people, and solving problems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The thrill of a good challenge is one of the reasons Roxana decided to help build Maple from the ground up. \u201cWe\u2019re using technology to connect people and healthcare providers in an instant, at any time of day, or night. As Canadians, we\u2019re incredibly proud of our healthcare system and the quality of our doctors, but quick access to care is a struggle for many of us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Roxana continues on Maple\u2019s hiring philosophy:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur vision, passion for innovation, and inclusive culture, have played a crucial role in our ability to attract top talent. In the process of building and growing our team, we\u2019re here to support and empower other women to join Maple, and to excel together in our journey as a tech company.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/christy-prada-7488b618\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=TlWxEs56TSyMwVD%2FNGO98Q%3D%3D\">Christy Prada<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 VP, Business Development<\/h3>\n<p>Christy is a former consultant in KPMG\u2019s healthcare strategy practice, and she holds an MBA from the Rotman School of Management. At Maple, Christy is primarily responsible for building strong, successful partnerships with various Canadian organizations, including employers, insurers, government entities, and other types of healthcare institutions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking in a tech start-up environment shouldn\u2019t be intimidating. I think there is a general misconception that you have to be a tech wiz to work in tech. I understand technology, analytics, and data, but I am by no means an expert. In order to build a successful tech company, you need people with many different backgrounds and skill sets.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shrampersad\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BBk6bVifTRAKnWjPUOqF9Ew%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=pMpYhnDdTmux3Gd0UjDc5A%3D%3D\">Shelly-Ann Rampersad<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 Director, Virtual Hospital Services<\/h3>\n<p>Shelly-Ann is a former strategy consultant with experience implementing system-wide health programs for governments around the world.

Under her leadership, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of innovation and bringing Maple into Canadian hospitals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo an extent, the tech world is very similar to the strategy consulting world \u2014 where the experience changes day by day (or even hour by hour) and is truly shaped by your attitude and what you make of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shelly-Ann\u2019s love for working in a fast paced environment and ability to build things from the ground up is why she excels at Maple. \u201cFor me, working in this industry is less about working for a tech start-up and more about finding work that I am passionate about.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lindsy-maren-fong-csp-2243672\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=s9T5bpPaSSKJK7B6xRfqrg%3D%3D\">Lindsy Fong<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 Director of Sales<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI come from a corporate background with a decade of experience in business.

I joined Maple as a Director of Sales not knowing what to expect.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lindsy admits that understanding all the technology and systems felt a bit overwhelming at first. \u201cPart of my role involves showing clients the value Maple can bring to their organization and teams, so understanding how the technology works is very important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lindsy\u2019s advice to women interested in tech:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a woman, and you want to be a part of the tech industry, you should take a shot! Don\u2019t be afraid that you don\u2019t know everything about tech \u2014 with determination and drive you can learn. And find a mentor to help support you through the tough times.

What made it feel more comfortable was having other female role models in tech to look up to. Without this, I might not have made the move, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with my choice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday, I\u2019m responsible for turning Maple into a household name in Canada and beyond. I enjoy using my skills in strategy to help spread awareness about what we\u2019re doing for the healthcare industry \u2013 my hope is that Maple becomes synonymous with virtual care in Canada.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/katiemmackay\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3B19zu5z1lTdCN3P930h%2BhVA%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=qYoS6oPzQr%2BqAMq%2F%2BAdGJw%3D%3D\">Katie MacKay<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 Manager, Communications &amp; Projects<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI spent 6 years working in PR agencies, creating strategies, content and events at breakneck speeds. When I left, the most terrifying thought was that I might end up doing a predictable, 9-5 job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI need to be tackling something new every day, and constantly analyzing results to make smarter moves in the future. With that in mind, I knew a tech start-up was exactly where I needed to land in my next career. When I was introduced to Maple, I couldn\u2019t believe my luck. I\u2019ve always been passionate about healthcare so I knew this is where I belonged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed by how collaborative the team is. If I don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re doing something, I simply ask the resident expert, who very likely sits less than 50 feet from me. It\u2019s an unbelievably tight-knit atmosphere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Katie\u2019s advice to women interested in tech:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to be part of a tech start-up, take the leap! Maple may be an outlier with such a female-oriented workforce, but every woman I know who works in tech finds it incredibly rewarding.

It\u2019s hard to come in as a tiny fish in a massive pond, and it feels nice to have people actually\u00a0know\u00a0you, and care to know you. \u201c<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy experience so far has been incredibly rewarding and challenging. I was fortunate enough to be a part of a private career college (HackerYou) that really places importance on getting women into tech, specializing in women (and female-identifying persons) in code. As I began learning the ins and outs of web development and coding, it was inspiring to have so many powerful, influential, and intelligent women teaching me some of the most complex things I have ever learned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking for a start-up can be a gamble, but if you believe in the company, the product, and your teammates, it\u2019s totally worth it. Tech companies are the future, and anything that\u2019s going to be the \u2018next big thing\u2019 has to start somewhere, so it\u2019s great to be a part of something early on and watching it grow and thrive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Leah\u2019s advice to women interested in tech:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGET INVOLVED! Don\u2019t let the male domination of the industry intimidate you. It isn\u2019t male-dominated because there aren\u2019t enough talented women and female-identifying people out there; believe me, I have been so fortunate to be surrounded by them daily. We are just at a crux where we need more talented women interested and involved. There are also tons of resources, communities, and workshops for women in tech. Take the step and you\u2019ll find so many others waiting on the other side with excited smiles and open arms.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tyra-sweet\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=4vvoxDbdSbWPGdTijLdiMQ%3D%3D\">Tyra Sweet\u00a0<\/a>\u2013 Client Engagement Specialist<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cOriginally, I worked in sales, but I didn\u2019t enjoy face-to-face sales.
