Should they send their kids back to school amidst a global pandemic?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happily, COVID-19 doesn\u2019t seem to affect young people in the same way that it affects older adults. Children tend to have very mild symptoms, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.publichealthontario.ca\/-\/media\/documents\/ncov\/what-we-know-children-feb-21-2020.pdf?la=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and most are completely asymptomatic.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s also where the complication lies, since it means kids could have COVID-19 without showing outward signs. Even though kids tend not to get as sick, they can still spread the disease to more vulnerable people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public health guidelines are different from one community to the next, so it\u2019s wise to check yours regularly. However, there are some general rules that parents can use to inform their decisions this fall. Here are some points to consider as you prepare for the upcoming school year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Screen your children for symptoms daily<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make screening your child for COVID-19 symptoms a part of your daily routine. By looking for signs of illness each day, you\u2019ll reduce the risk of sending a sick kid to school. Here are warning signs that a young person may have COVID-19:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fatigue<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cough<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trouble breathing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Temperature at or over 38\u00b0C<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chills<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muscle pain<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body aches<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headache<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gastrointestinal issues like stomach ache, diarrhea or vomiting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally feeling unwell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information on what to consider for children of all ages when screening for COVID-19, consider these resources:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid19\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple COVID-19 resource centre<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/symptoms.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Canada &#8211; COVID-19 Symptoms and Treatment<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.publichealthontario.ca\/-\/media\/documents\/ncov\/what-we-know-children-feb-21-2020.pdf?la=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Health Ontario: What we know so far about COVID-19 and children<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals\/guidance-schools-childcare-programs.html#a3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heath Canada &#8211; COVID-19 guidance for schools Kindergarten to Grade 12<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Consider the health of everyone in your home<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending your kids back to school ups the risk of infection for everyone in your household.

For some kids, the structure of school provides a comforting routine. And, they\u2019ll probably be over-the-moon to see their friends again. But every child is different, and it\u2019s possible that your children are nervous about going to school in pandemic times. Make space for conversations about feelings and mental health this September. Kids can have a hard time articulating their feelings, so reading a storybook or sharing a fun activity can be good segues into vulnerable conversations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure how to begin talking to your kids about mental health during COVID-19?

Making them a fun and normal part of the day will help your kids get used to wearing them, and seeing them on others. Here are a few ways to normalize wearing a mask with your kids:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear them at home. Even if for short periods, putting on masks at home will help your kids get used to seeing adults with them on.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remind your kids their favourite superheroes wear masks too.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose masks in your child\u2019s favourite colour, or a fun pattern.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain that the masks protect other kids and their families.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every school requires students to wear masks. Be sure to check your child\u2019s school for their policy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For tips on how to explain masks to kids and common questions kids ask, look here:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/13\/well\/family\/coronavirus-children-masks-fear.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times &#8211; Children May Be Afraid of Masks.

Your bubble consists of yourself, your household members, and whichever select individuals you\u2019ve agreed to socialize with. Yes, your children will be exposed to people outside of your bubble if they&#8217;re attending school. That doesn\u2019t mean that adults should expand their bubbles too. In fact, the increased risk of exposure with back-to-school means we should exercise more caution. Limiting exposure could save lives, so maintaining your social bubble is a high priority.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure how to form your contact bubble?
