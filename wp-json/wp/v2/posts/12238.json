Ask a dermatologist."},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Skincare is an important aspect of health and wellbeing that\u2019s so often overlooked. A lot of us don\u2019t establish a regular skincare routine until we run into an issue, like breakouts in our teenage years, or wrinkles as we get older. That\u2019s because when we\u2019re young, we aren\u2019t taught to take care of our skin on a daily basis like we do our teeth, hair, and diet.<\/p>\n<p>If you have acne, you\u2019re not alone. <a href=\"https:\/\/dermatology.ca\/public-patients\/skin\/acne\/\">Almost 5.6 million Canadians have acne<\/a> too, from age 12 to well into adulthood. Because there are several different skin types, and lots of factors that go into having healthy skin, figuring out the best acne treatment for you can be a challenge. The key is getting to know your skin, and sticking to a routine.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, talking to a pro is most helpful. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\">dermatologist<\/a>\u00a0can help you tailor a skincare routine and medication regimen that will set you on the road to great skin. To get you started, here\u2019s some tried and true advice that\u2019s dermatologist approved.<\/p>\n<h2>Causes of acne<\/h2>\n<p>Acne is a condition that affects your skin\u2019s pores and oil glands. Doctors still don\u2019t know exactly what causes acne, but factors like hormones and skin cleanliness are thought to play a role. Acne tends to manifest as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Whiteheads<\/span>: clogged pores that create pimples that stay under the surface of the skin<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Blackheads<\/span>: pimples that rise to the skin\u2019s surface and are open<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Papules<\/span>: small, tender pink or red bumps<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pustules<\/span>: pimples that are red (resembling papules) at the bottom and have pus on top<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nodules<\/span>: red, large and painful pimples that are deep under the skin\u2019s surface<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Cysts<\/span>: painful, pus-filled pimples deep under the skin that often cause redness and scarring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sometimes acne symptoms are caused by blocked pores. Oil, dirt buildup, and dead skin cells can all be contributing factors. Facial acne and back acne are common, but you can get acne on your chest and shoulders too. To start finding solutions, it\u2019s important to know what your skin type is so that you can use treatments that complement your skin\u2019s composition.<\/p>\n<h2>Skin types<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know there are five different skin types, and that you should use a different acne treatment depending on the type of skin you have? That\u2019s one of the reasons it can be tough to narrow down the best remedy for skin trouble \u2014 there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. Another tricky factor is that as we age, our skin type can change. External factors like sun or smoking can have an impact on your skin type, and internal factors like hormonal changes also play a role.<\/p>\n<p>The five skin types are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Normal<\/span>: Like the name suggests, people with normal skin type don\u2019t have much imbalance at all, meaning their skin isn\u2019t excessively oily or very dry. They have few imperfections like spots, minimally visible pores, and few wrinkles. Normal skin is most often found in young people<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Combination<\/span>: This skin type is really common. Combination skin means some areas of the face are dry or oily, while the rest of the skin is normal. Usually the dry and\/or oily patches are in the t-zone, which is the area across your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, and across your chin. You may also have blackheads if you have combination skin.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Oily<\/span>: Because oil can clog pores, people with oily skin often have trouble with blackheads or pimples. Enlarged pores and shiny skin are signs of an oily complexion.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dry<\/span>: People with dry skin have small pores, and rough skin that often flakes off. You\u2019re more likely to have skin with less elasticity, which leads to a less vibrant complexion, redness, and wrinkles.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sensitive<\/span>: Sensitive skin presents itself through irritations like redness or itching, and sometimes burning, especially if you\u2019re using products your skin doesn\u2019t like, which can cause flare ups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Prescriptions for acne<\/h2>\n<p>Good news! There are lots of options for acne treatment. A dermatologist can help you choose a treatment that\u2019s right for you. Here are a few common medicines that fight acne:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Topical prescriptions<\/span>: there are many topical cream options a dermatologist may prescribe to treat acne. Most of them contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients help reduce oil production and inflammation.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Oral prescriptions<\/span>: some types of acne don\u2019t respond to topical remedies, and in those cases there are treatment options in pill form. Commonly prescribed oral medications for acne include: Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Minocycline, and Doxycycline. A dermatologist can help you decide which of these options is the best idea for you.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hormonal agents<\/span>: For women, some dermatologists may suggest hormonal oral contraceptives (\u201cthe pill\u201d), which are known to alleviate acne.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some medications have side effects, like dry, irritated skin. Others may have more serious side effects, so it\u2019s important to work with your dermatologist to find the solution that\u2019s best for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Simple starts<\/h2>\n<p>Healthy skin starts from the inside out. There are everyday things you can do to clear your skin and maintain a healthy glow. Here are a few ideas to kickstart your acne treatment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pay attention to your diet. <\/span><br \/>\nAvoid fried and sugary food. They spike your insulin production, which causes inflammation throughout your body \u2014 including in your skin. Choosing healthy foods like leafy greens has the opposite effect to sugars. They give the body a boost in anti inflammatory properties because they\u2019re rich in vitamin K, which helps fight the redness and swelling that comes with acne.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Build a morning and night routine. <\/span><br \/>\nMake sure that your morning routine includes products that are well suited to your skin type, and don\u2019t forget to cleanse your face at night to remove the dirt buildup from the day. If you wear makeup, it\u2019s the best way to ensure you\u2019re not falling asleep with anything on your face that might clog your pores.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Drink lots of water. <\/span><br \/>\nWhen your skin is hydrated, it\u2019s happy! Proper hydration means your body doesn\u2019t have to produce excess oils to protect the skin, which can contribute to acne breakouts.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Get a good night\u2019s sleep. <\/span><br \/>\nYour body naturally makes repairs while you sleep \u2014 including healing your skin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Seeing a dermatologist<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re having trouble managing your acne, or you have scarring, you might want to visit an acne clinic.
