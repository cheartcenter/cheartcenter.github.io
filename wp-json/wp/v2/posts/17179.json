Not only is it major surgery, but you now have a tiny human depending on you for literally everything. But while it\u2019s hard to take proper care of yourself as a new parent, it\u2019s crucial. If you don\u2019t, you could be setting yourself up for future problems \u2014 and we\u2019re not just talking about bad hair days. Here\u2019s everything you need to know for a quick <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovery after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a C-section?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Cesarean section, also known as a C-section or Cesarean birth is when your baby is delivered through a cut in your abdomen. In Canada, you can choose to have one without a medical reason, but most doctors recommend C-section delivery only if it\u2019s medically necessary. Your doctor may schedule you for one ahead of time if the baby is breech (facing feet first) or if the mother has a pre-existing condition, for example. Alternatively, they may determine during labour that a cesarean is necessary \u2014 if the baby goes into distress, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin the C-section procedure, an anesthetist gives you an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cas.ca\/en\/about-cas\/advocacy\/anesthesia-faq\/what-is-an-epidural#:~:text=An%20'epidural'%20is%20a%20type,is%20injected%20through%20the%20catheter.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">epidural<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to numb your abdomen. The epidural affects only a specific region so you\u2019ll be awake for the whole procedure. Once the epidural takes effect, the doctor makes an incision on your lower abdomen through which they remove the baby and placenta. After the baby and placenta are out, the doctor closes the incision with stitches. Sometimes \u2013 if the baby goes into distress, for example, there isn\u2019t time for an epidural. In these cases, the anesthetist will give you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cags-accg.ca\/patient-care\/types-of-anesthesia\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">general anesthesia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead which means you won\u2019t be awake for the procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Recovering after your C-section<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivering<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> via <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cesarean<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> typically takes a little longer to recover from than if you deliver vaginally. That\u2019s because the doctor cuts through both your abdomen and your uterus to remove the baby. So while your stitches may start dissolving after a couple of days, it takes much longer to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heal internally after a C-section<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal pain<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section recovery can <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last for a while and you might have to take pain medication for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tn8162\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one to two weeks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the procedure. But by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three weeks after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cramping<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should subside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you deliver vaginally or via cesarean, the cardinal rule of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/surviving-birth-what-to-expect-when-youre-postpartum\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum recovery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not to lift anything heavier than your baby for the first six weeks. Unfortunately for them, that also means you can\u2019t <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lift<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toddler after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (no matter how much they whine). Your doctor will examine you at your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postpartum checkup<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six weeks after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see how you\u2019re healing. If everything looks good, they\u2019ll clear you to resume your normal activities. But even with your doctor\u2019s sign off, keep in mind that your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">body at six weeks postpartum<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still fragile. Try to get as much rest as possible and give yourself a while to ease back into the swing of things. In other words, feel free to put your partner on dinner, dishes and diaper duty!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Potential C-section complications<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While complications are possible, C-sections are typically quite safe. One of the major differences between the procedure and a vaginal delivery is that you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer to hold your baby while the doctor stitches you up. Typically, having a C-section also means a longer stay in hospital. This gives your healthcare team a chance to monitor you for any abnormal <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signs of internal bleeding after<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like heavy vaginal bleeding, blurred vision and chills, fast heartbeat and pale complexion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019re home, keep an eye out for any signs of infection at the wound site such as redness, swelling or discharge from your incision area. As well, while lochia (discharge after pregnancy) can continue for up to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ontarioprenataleducation.ca\/recovery-after-birth\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six weeks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you generally shouldn\u2019t be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bleeding at six weeks postpartum<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If anything seems abnormal, contact your doctor or midwife right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s a VBAC and why should I care?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve had a C-section, any future vaginal births are dubbed VBACs (vaginal birth after Cesarean). Having a C-section leaves you with scar tissue on your uterus, and during a VBAC, there\u2019s a risk that the scar from your previous C-section could open, which is called a uterine rupture (terrifying much?!). The chances of having a uterine rupture increase with each C-section. So once you\u2019ve had two, your doctor will consider C-section as the safest way to deliver all future children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you deliver via C-section or vaginally, the postpartum recovery can be rough. Reaching, lifting and carrying are all going to be harder to do than usual. This is pretty inconvenient considering most newborns want to be chauffeured around in their parents\u2019 arms pretty much constantly. This means that you need help \u2014 it takes a village as the saying goes. Try to enlist as much support as possible to make the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovery after <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C-section <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as quick as possible. You\u2019re on duty for the next 18 years \u2014 and then some. Take some time to ease into your new role.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a baby is a huge adjustment.
