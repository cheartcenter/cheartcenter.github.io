It\u2019s a time to reflect on how small businesses are truly the backbones of our communities, and Canada\u2019s economy. There are over 1.2 million small businesses in Canada. They represent 98% of Canada\u2019s businesses, and they\u2019re at dire risk from the circumstances of COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses have reported more COVID-19 related losses than medium or large businesses. They\u2019ve seen greater revenue dips than larger companies, and have had to lay off more staff. Nearly every small business owner has wondered if they\u2019ll be able to weather the COVID-19 storm, or if permanent closure would be the better option.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a small business, there\u2019s no clear roadmap for how to navigate the ongoing challenges. As with all things COVID-19, resources are dispersed across the internet, and sensible advice comes second after reactionary headlines. The following tips come from financial and business experts. They may not be a perfect fit for your business, but they should shed some insight on the pockets of opportunity in this new landscape.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Take stock of your finances<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with all large-scale endeavours, it\u2019s important to understand your current standing and resources before making new decisions. Create a COVID-19 costs and balance sheet, totalling your financial reserves and recurring expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses are advised to have six months of cash stowed away for times of emergency. This would certainly be one of those times. Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult for small businesses to amass that much reserves. Even larger businesses struggle to meet that target. It\u2019s one of the reasons small businesses have taken a harder hit from COVID-19. They tend not to have the financial safety net to withstand a series of low-revenue months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve surmised your financial situation, look for programs and grants to lower your costs. A few ways to start are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Re-negotiating your rent with your landlord.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking to your bank about what relief programs are available for small businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/department-finance\/economic-response-plan.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government of Canada website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see what wage subsidy programs you\u2019re eligible for.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/betakit.com\/heres-how-cdntech-companies-are-pitching-in-during-the-covid-19-outbreak\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tapping into Canada\u2019s startup network<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for free business and technology services.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the time for tough decisions. Scrutinize every business cost on your balance sheet. Trim anything that isn\u2019t necessary right now. Look for which products and services make the most money for you. Those are your profit centres. Carry more of those profit centre items, promote them through advertising, and focus your business around what\u2019s moving the most units.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Go digital<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can your business sell its inventory online? Can it offer classes or consultations over video conference? Is there a way for customers to financially support you online? If there\u2019s any way to move your business over to digital, do it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts project the in-person economy will take years to revert to pre-coronavirus levels. In the meantime, customers are living more of their lives and doing more of their shopping on the internet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some impactful ways to start your online business presence:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a website. You don\u2019t need to have any coding knowledge to create a professional-looking website. There are website-building services like <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/wix.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wix<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/squarespace.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squarespace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that make it easy to create sleek and modern sites.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create content for social media. Customers engage with brands over platforms like Instagram and Facebook. If your business is in the consumer-goods space, you can set up aesthetically-pleasing photoshoots that are likely to gain traction on visually-oriented social media platforms.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start email marketing. Email is one of the most effective ways to communicate with your customers, and it doesn\u2019t have to cost a thing. There are many <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/free-email-marketing-tools\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free bulk email sending tools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Of course, you\u2019ll get more power and functionality from a paid plan. You can use email to communicate about promotions, send out useful content, and keep customers updated as to re-opening plans and policies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts estimate that the pandemic has advanced the online and e-commerce economy by 10 years. If anything is \u201chot\u201d right now, it\u2019s online shopping and services. While an online business may not replace the magic of in-person community, it\u2019s a great way to keep revenue coming in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Create a safe environment for employees and customers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rebound of our economy will depend on how confident customers feel returning to public spaces. Experts project it will take years for Canadians to feel fully confident shopping and living as they did before. The best thing you can do to speed this process along is to lead by example when it comes to safety procedures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an investment in community health, and in customers\u2019 perception of your business. Stock up on hand sanitizer, face masks, plexiglass dividers, and physical distancing floor markers. Put posters up communicating your stringent safety measures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the same token, your employees need to feel comfortable returning to work. You\u2019re likely running on a lean staff count right now, and the short or long-term absence of any employee will be deeply felt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let employees ask whatever questions they need to, and provide direct, honest answers. Introduce safety policies like face masks, frequent hand-washing, and temperature checks. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/six-tips-for-bringing-your-staff-back-to-the-office-safely\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a good starting plan for bringing employees back to your workplace safely.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a good idea to offer more employee health resources, such as more days off, and enhanced health benefits. Virtual care is a terrific benefit to offer as it gives employees a direct connection to a doctor, 24\/7. They can attend to any health concerns without missing out on work, feeling safer and supported.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Encourage Canadians to shop local<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone should take note of this tip \u2014 now is the time to support small businesses with your dollars. If and when you can, choose your local small businesses to shop for quarantine essentials and holiday gifts. $30 doesn\u2019t mean much to a big multi-national corporation, but a few $30 purchases could mean the world to a small business\u2019s survival. Encourage local shopping on social media, with posters in your shop windows, and through word-of-mouth. It\u2019s a good reminder to everyone that shopping isn\u2019t just about convenience. It\u2019s also about supporting the businesses that we love to see thriving.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is no ordinary small business month. We commend the small businesses who\u2019ve been persevering through these exceptional times. It will be a beautiful sight when small businesses are all fully-operational, and people are shopping freely. Until then, small businesses are doing what they\u2019re best at \u2014 coming up with ingenuitive solutions based on their resources at-hand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in offering virtual care for your employees, we\u2019ve launched our new Smart Business Health Plan. This is our lowest-priced plan, giving you the core benefits of a virtual care program without extra administrative costs. Get in touch if you\u2019d like to know more. We\u2019re happy to support small businesses with accessible healthcare to keep employees, and operations healthy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many local businesses are in financial danger with COVID-19.
