Nearly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2515351\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">70% of your immune system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> resides in your gut, and science is beginning to discover how gut health impacts overall wellness. From skin concerns like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/rosacea-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rosacea<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to digestive complaints like constipation, many chronic health issues may have their roots in the internal microbiome. Here\u2019s how a naturopathic doctor can help with gut health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s really going on in your gut<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each of our bodies plays host to about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5665491\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">100 trillion microorganisms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They\u2019re so prevalent, that scientists think the ratio of these microbes to our own cells is one-to-one. The number one spot these little guys congregate is in our gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). So many are present there, that it contains somewhere between one to two kilograms of them. These gut microorganisms play crucial roles in our bodies\u2019 functioning. They&#8217;re instrumental in everything <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0from how our digestion and immune systems operate, to regulating our moods and inhibiting inflammation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s involved in a naturopathic consultation?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your first consultation with a naturopathic doctor will begin with an in-depth discussion of current health concerns. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They&#8217;ll also cover other relevant topics like your diet, sleep, medical and family history, and stress levels. This allows them to gather the information they need to investigate the root cause of your concerns. Depending on what they uncover, your naturopathic doctor might recommend more comprehensive testing. They\u2019ll also help you devise a treatment plan. This may include supplements, herbal recommendations, dietary modifications, and lifestyle support such as stress management techniques.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are you living with unwanted intestinal guests?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While each of us hosts a diversity of microorganisms, there are certain ones that shouldn&#8217;t be part of our microbiome. When we find ourselves invaded by, say, a parasite, it can wreak havoc on our gut health. If you spent part of your 20s drinking tap water in Bolivia, or eating from a roadside vendor in Thailand and developed digestive complaints afterwards, this might be applicable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luckily, stool tests are part of a naturopathic doctor\u2019s arsenal. These tests can look for things like parasites, or undesirable bacteria, or viruses that may be residing in your gut. Hosting a parasite or a malevolent bacterial colony may sound distressing. Once you know, however, your naturopathic doctor can devise a treatment plan. With the right antibiotic or naturopathic prescription, you can say goodbye to any unwanted gastrointestinal tenants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What your breath says about your gut health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your microbiome is affected by many different factors, including how you\u2019re born, and whether you\u2019re breastfed, which medicines and antibiotics you take, as well as which foods you eat. Naturopathic doctors focus on balancing the microbiome. One of the ways they do this is by looking at which bacteria are present in your gut. One tool at their disposal is a breath test. This at-home diagnostic test kit looks at the different gases present in your exhalations, and can showcase which bacteria may be present in your GI tract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A common issue easily diagnosed with a breath test is SIBO, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. SIBO is when a species of bacteria becomes too prevalent in your small intestines. When this happens, the bacteria often emits high levels of hydrogen. This can cause uncomfortable issues like bloating, loose stool, gas, diarrhea, nausea, feeling uncomfortably full, and in severe cases, malnutrition \u2014 basically every digestive symptom you don\u2019t want. If your breath test indicates SIBO, your naturopathic doctor can prescribe a treatment plan to eradicate the bad bacteria and heal your gut to rebalance your inner microbiome.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How your saliva can impact your gut<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like your gut, your mouth is also home to a plethora of different bacteria species. Since what you swallow ends up in your gut, your mouth bacteria is potentially tied to your gut health. The bacteria associated with gingivitis, for example, is implicated in dysbiosis (imbalance) of the gut bacteria in susceptible individuals. Although more research is required, some scientists believe that some kinds of oral bacteria <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fped.2020.620254\/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">may even play a role<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). If you\u2019re experiencing gut issues, saliva tests are another tool naturopathic doctors can use to assess what may be going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Gut health and your immune system<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leaky gut could be a term you\u2019ve heard at some point \u2013 maybe as an explanation of an autoimmune condition, or even depression. While the research is still out on the full details, preliminary evidence suggests that certain bacteria and food can traverse the lining of the gut. From there, they enter the bloodstream, sparking inflammation. This inflammation can play a part in a number of conditions, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6658985\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, multiple sclerosis, and certain forms of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/arthritis.ca\/about-arthritis\/arthritis-types-(a-z)\/types\/inflammatory-arthritis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">arthritis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Your naturopath can work with you to determine if you may be experiencing a leaky gut as the result of food intolerances or other factors, and help you devise a treatment plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re experiencing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/what-your-digestive-issues-are-telling-you-about-your-health\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">digestive difficulties<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a naturopathic doctor can help you track down the root causes. From chronic constipation to diarrhea, and everything in between, digestive issues can be pretty uncomfortable. The good news is you don\u2019t have to resign yourself to living with uncomfortable GI symptoms. Speak to a naturopathic doctor about how they can help you rebalance your microbiome for a healthier gut.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you feel like the impact of your gut health goes beyond how well you digest your food, you\u2019re not alone.
