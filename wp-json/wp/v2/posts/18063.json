But the real tragic stories occur within individual families, when a loved one passes away without friends or relatives by their side.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With current restrictions on group gatherings, the pandemic has taken away our usual ways of mourning loved ones. So how can we cope without our traditional methods of paying final respects? The following strategies can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that grief is an individual process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each person handles grief differently. Give yourself permission to feel whatever you\u2019re feeling. For starters, there\u2019s no time limit on grief. It\u2019s possible to feel acute loss years or even decades after a death. And while some people feel overwhelming sadness, it&#8217;s also normal to be ambivalent, angry, or even relieved about the death of a loved one. In other words, don&#8217;t feel bad if you don\u2019t feel sad. A wide range of emotions is normal and valid, and have no bearing on how much you loved the person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can I mourn while physically distancing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most cultures mourn collectively. Humans are social animals, so touch and face-to-face contact are instrumental in supporting one another. From visitations, to wakes, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chabad.org\/library\/article_cdo\/aid\/282506\/jewish\/Soul-Talk.htm?gclid=CjwKCAiAl4WABhAJEiwATUnEFyEt1mzvQ38x9AimRk6bndZib-NPcei_-KqCn1CM7caFnrimkFekuhoCjPsQAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sitting shiva<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it&#8217;s built into society that individuals aren&#8217;t alone after their loved one&#8217;s passing. Physical distancing makes these traditions impossible right now, at least in their typical format. Despite that, we still have other ways of connecting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many funeral services are now held online so loved ones can attend remotely. Talking on the phone and video calls can also help you feel less alone. Whether it&#8217;s on Zoom, the telephone, or conversing through a window, sharing memories of our loved ones is a wonderful way of honouring their memory. And, collectivism is one of the most important tools we have for coping with grief. If you need more support, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grief counselling<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also available remotely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t want to talk about it. What else can I do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has changed the way we connect, and it can sometimes make us forget about other avenues that are open to us. Writing and sending letters about the deceased, or sharing photos or mementos are powerful ways of evoking their memory. Journaling your recollections of them can also be comforting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re spiritual or religious, you may find that tapping into faith is helpful. Most religious organizations are now holding virtual services. Praying or listening with others can foster a sense of community.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take care of yourself physically<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grief has a way of making even basic tasks feel overwhelming. Still, taking care of yourself physically is a key part of caring for yourself emotionally. There\u2019s no need for elaborate at-home spa days, but bathing, brushing your teeth, and changing your clothes every day are crucial. Fresh air and exercise also help greatly. Exercise releases endorphins <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/toronto.cmha.ca\/documents\/benefits-of-good-mental-health\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which feel good<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and may even keep depression at bay. So take a few minutes for a fun, doable exercise session. Take a daily walk, or look up some light-hearted dance-inspired workouts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accept support<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People often wonder what they can do to help when someone they know is grieving. Flowers and cards are nice, but handmade items go the extra mile. There are few things more comforting than a freshly baked loaf of bread. Since cooking can feel too demanding when you\u2019re coping with loss, let your friends know that a home-cooked meal would be welcome.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan for the future<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 isn&#8217;t going to last forever \u2014 we\u2019ll be together again in the future. Plan an in-person remembrance event to celebrate your loved one&#8217;s life once the pandemic is over. Consider hosting a party, holding a tree-planting ceremony, or scattering their ashes. There are many unique and non-traditional possibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coping with the death of a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic is a lot. With time and support, however, you will get through this difficult period. It&#8217;s also important to know the difference between grief and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/depression-signs-and-symptoms-how-to-recognize-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you feel hopeless, like you can\u2019t function or have thoughts of self-harm, your grief has crossed that line. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we lose a loved one, we turn to our communities for support.
