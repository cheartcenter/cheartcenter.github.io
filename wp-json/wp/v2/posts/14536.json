Most adults spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. Because of COVID-19, many people are still adjusting to working remotely from home. Spending a lot of time in the same environment while not seeing colleagues in person every day can take its toll on mental health. A stressful or taxing work environment can also contribute to the rise of mental health problems, which in turn has serious economic repercussions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/canadasafetycouncil.org\/mental-health-and-the-workplace\/#:~:text=Mental%20health%20claims%20are%20the,Canada's%20major%20insurers%20and%20employers.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada Safety Council<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, mental health claims are the fastest growing category of disability costs in Canada. Th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e economic burden of mental health problems in Canada is estimated at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$51 billion per year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes healthcare costs, lost productivity, absenteeism, and reductions in quality of life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Mental health barriers in the workplace<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health includes an employee\u2019s psychological, emotional, and social well-being. It affects how a person makes choices, relates to others, handles stress, and much more. Just like physical health, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mental health affects everyone. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect an employee\u2019s mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To create a caring, safe, and healthy workplace culture that\u2019s free of excessive mental stress, an organization&#8217;s commitment has to start at the top.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply e<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mphasizing that mental health is just as important as physical health can go a long way and help reduce stigma in the workplace. Other ways you can <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a positive impact on mental health include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting work-life balance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouraging respectful behaviours, with a zero-tolerance policy for harassment.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing workloads.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having conflict resolution practices in place.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognizing employees&#8217; contributions effectively.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health still carries a stigma in the workplace and broader society. This often results in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employees becoming fearful of being shamed or discriminated against if they come forward to speak to their manager about what\u2019s affecting them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering mental health educational resources and support can make a big difference. Organizations should let their employees know that it\u2019s not a weakness to admit they\u2019re experiencing mental health issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For employees to feel comfortable speaking up, they need to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a positive relationship with a supportive manager. If an employee believes mental health is looked down upon in the organization, they will be less likely to risk being vulnerable. It\u2019s important to educate your managers on how to address and talk to their employees about mental health issues, to let employees know that mental health issues will be treated with compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms of mental health distress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health distress can differ from person to person, making it difficult for employers to recognize symptoms in employees. In any given year, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/fast-facts-about-mental-illness\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five people in Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personally experience a mental health problem or illness. Be aware of some of the common signs, including:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling sad or down<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mood changes, with more highs and more lows<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced ability to concentrate<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessive fears or worries<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extreme feelings of guilt<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Withdrawal from friends and activities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low energy or problems sleeping<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulties coping with daily problems or stress<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes in eating habits<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be hard for employees to recognize that they\u2019re experiencing mental health distress as it starts to feel familiar, or even normal. It\u2019s important to communicate often about common signs and symptoms, and provide education around mental health to help <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employees more easily recognize their symptoms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why virtual care is a game changer for mental health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With virtual care, employees can speak with a therapist from anywhere. They can schedule an appointment at a time that\u2019s convenient for them or speak with someone as soon as possible. This flexibility removes friction when employees decide to seek help, making it easier to treat mental health problems affecting their performance at work or life at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world continues to adapt to remote working arrangements, telemedicine is well-positioned to support employees regardless of their location. Telemedicine provides access to a wide range of therapists and eliminates many barriers allowing for an efficient and convenient way to access the help they need without fearing judgment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in adding virtual care to your employee benefits package, or if you\u2019d like more information about online counselling, get in touch.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With COVID-19 and the transition to working remotely, employee mental health is under stress.
