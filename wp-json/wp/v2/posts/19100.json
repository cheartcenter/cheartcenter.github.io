Maybe it\u2019s a big presentation on the horizon, or waiting for important news. Whatever the reason, a little worry is natural. It\u2019s when you can\u2019t stop worrying, or find yourself preoccupied with how something will turn out, that worry becomes unhealthy. If you\u2019re finding your sense of worry is becoming overwhelming, here are some tips to calm your mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Practice mindfulness<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the current moment. It\u2019s a type of meditation where you observe anxious or worried thoughts without judgment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more mindful you become, the less your worried thoughts will spiral out of control. You\u2019ll be able to observe a worried thought without having a distressed emotional reaction. Since both your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wbur.org\/commonhealth\/2018\/04\/06\/harvard-study-relax-genes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">body<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and mind suffer when you\u2019re worried or stressed, worrying less benefits your whole-body health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.ca\/documents\/mindfulness\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mindfulness. A simple way is to check in with yourself each day, paying attention to how your body feels and what\u2019s going on in your mind. Or, try taking a walk and intentionally using all your senses to take in the environment around you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Take a walk or jog<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving your body is a great way to get out of your head and stop worrying about the future. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1470658\/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show that exercise like walking or jogging for 30 minutes per day, three days each week has benefits such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing anxiety<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your sleep<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your mood<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 30 minutes of exercise don\u2019t have to be consecutive to be effective. The next time you have a stressful day coming up, schedule time for three brisk, 10 minute walks to help clear your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Reach out to someone you trust<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes worrying can lead to irrational thinking. We play out all the ways things can go wrong in our heads, even when it\u2019s unlikely that the worst will happen. A second opinion is always helpful. Try sharing your concerns with a friend or family member to gain some perspective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Plan out the worst case scenario<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good plan can go a long way towards relieving stress. Oftentimes our worries stem from feeling like we don\u2019t have control over a situation. Planning for all possible outcomes can give you a newfound sense of control. This can take the stress out of navigating the unknown.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Journal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people find it hard to express what exactly is causing their stress. This can lead to even more worry, since they can\u2019t articulate their uncomfortable feelings. Journaling is a therapeutic practice that helps narrow down what\u2019s really underlying your intrusive, uncomfortable thoughts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try writing down what\u2019s on your mind the next time you feel worried. Include details of what&#8217;s currently going on in your daily life. Reading over your journal at a later date can help you spot patterns and stress triggers.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Designate time just for worrying<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting aside specified <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/healthypsych.com\/psychology-tools-schedule-worry-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worrying time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can actually help you manage your moods. Instead of letting worrying pervasively interrupt your day, jot down any worries and make a plan to revisit them later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During your worry time, 30 minutes a day for example, think through the worries on your list. Write ideas for short-term solutions to each problem. As you tackle each item, your list will eventually get shorter.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Do a body scan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress and worries can make your body tense. When you\u2019re worried, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones are part of your fight or flight response. When your body has elevated levels of these hormones, your muscles get tense in preparation for flight-mode, even if there\u2019s no real danger.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing a body scan can help counteract the effects of worry on your body. Seated or lying down in a comfortable position, progressively focus your attention from your head, slowly to your toes. Notice every tactile sensation, including the temperature of the air, the fabric of your clothes, and the weight of your limbs. When you notice tension, take a deep breath and focus on relaxing the areas that are tight. Your mind and body are connected, so a relaxed body acts as a gateway to a relaxed mind.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. See a therapist<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/report-on-business\/careers\/workplace-award\/how-talk-therapy-can-improve-your-mental-health\/article34604490\/#:~:text=A%20growing%20body%20of%20research,cent%20of%20all%20psychiatric%20diagnoses.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a professional about your worries is the best way to process and overcome them. Therapy gets to the root of your worries, such as traumatic life events or schemas through which you see the world. Therapists can also recommend mental and physical techniques to help make your worries more manageable so they don\u2019t interfere with daily life.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Turn off your phone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notifications, emails, calls \u2014 we\u2019re constantly looking at our phones. Although they\u2019re a great tool, taking a break from your smartphone gives you a break from stressors. Take some daily downtime without your phone. Resist the urge to check on work emails after-hours, and know that most notifications don\u2019t require an urgent reply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Face your worry head-on<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, the only way out of a situation is going through it. If there\u2019s something in particular that\u2019s making you feel worried, facing the fear in a safe manner can help. Once you\u2019ve confronted the situation that worries you, the experience will help you reframe your worries in the future. By facing our worries and overcoming them, we build confidence in ourselves to competently handle future challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is there are lots of ways to stop the habit of worrying. If your worries are getting in the way of your daily life, our therapists can help. You can speak to a therapist from home for convenience and comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everybody gets worried from time to time.
