Diet and exercise are the cornerstones of good health, so it\u2019s little surprise that nutrition plays a role in combating chronic illness. What\u2019s less clear, however, is how nutrition interacts with ovarian cysts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turns out, you don\u2019t need to have ovarian cysts to be diagnosed with PCOS. A diagnosis requires the presence of two of three factors \u2014 irregular menstruation, high androgen levels, and ovarian cysts. PCOS is a condition that hinges on hormone levels, and diet and exercise play a big role in healthy hormone balance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find so much material about the so-called \u201cPCOS diet\u201d if you ask Dr. Google. Lifestyle changes can be enough to treat some milder cases of PCOS. But be wary of special, sometimes expensive, PCOS diet and exercise plans that sound too good to be true. They likely are just that. For most, while diet and exercise can help manage symptoms, it\u2019s not the miracle cure it\u2019s often reported to be.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insulin resistance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, let\u2019s understand what insulin resistance means. Insulin is a hormone that helps your muscles, fat, and liver utilize glucose for energy. You get glucose, a type of sugar, mostly from the food you eat. It circulates in your bloodstream until insulin delivers it to an area of your body that requires energy. Insulin resistance happens when your body responds poorly to insulin. In that case, glucose builds up in your bloodstream and creates chronically high blood sugars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a double-whammy with insulin resistance. First, high blood sugar levels spur your body to produce more androgens. That\u2019s how PCOS comes about for some individuals. Once you have PCOS, high blood sugar strikes again by worsening symptoms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many, but not all, people with PCOS deal with insulin resistance. More than 50% will develop prediabetes or diabetes by age 40. There are certain risk factors that raise your chances of developing diabetes. These risk factors can also exacerbate PCOS:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight \u2014 the more fatty tissue you have, especially around your midsection, the greater your chances of being insulin resistant.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sedentary lifestyle \u2014 exercise helps with weight regulation, and makes your body use glucose to fuel its efforts.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family history \u2014 having one or more immediate diabetic family members increases your chances for developing insulin resistance.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Race \u2014 for unclear reasons, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Indigenous people develop diabetes at higher rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High blood pressure \u2014 a blood pressure of 140\/90 increases your risk of diabetes.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abnormal cholesterol and triglycerides \u2014 having low levels of the \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol is associated with diabetes. So are high levels of triglycerides, a fat carried in your bloodstream.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The link between PCOS and diet<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since PCOS and insulin resistance are so closely linked, diet interventions focus on lowering and stabilizing blood sugars. If you ask doctors, there\u2019s really no \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS diet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d A diet that will reduce PCOS symptoms is much the same as a diet for people with diabetes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with PCOS, diabetes, or no health complications all have the same basic nutritional needs. We all require vitamins, minerals, and enough fat, protein, and carbohydrates to stay fueled throughout the day. When creating a diet plan for PCOS, the focus is on foods that don\u2019t spike blood sugar. Over time, healthy foods can regulate blood sugar, help with weight loss (if necessary), and reduce symptoms of PCOS and diabetes to barely noticeable levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods to eat when you have PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-fibre foods<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fibre is a powerhouse nutrient for people who are insulin resistant. It can\u2019t be fully digested by your body. You\u2019d think that\u2019d be awful for your health, but it\u2019s actually terrific. Fibre slows the passage of food through your digestive tract, which slows down your body\u2019s absorption of glucose. That means fewer blood sugar spikes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also feel fuller after a meal if fibre is giving you that stick-to-your-ribs feeling. A great bonus \u2014 fibre is only found in plant foods, most abundantly in fruits and vegetables. When you include high-fibre foods in your diet, you\u2019ll be consuming lots of vitamins and minerals that come in handy plant packages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some high-fibre foods are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oatmeal<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lentils<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berries<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citrus fruits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apples<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All vegetables<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown rice<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nuts<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegetables<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to eat too many vegetables on a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS diet plan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You should aim to build your diet around whole plant foods. They\u2019re low in calorie density, and high in fibre and essential nutrients. All told, increasing your intake of vegetables is proven to have insulin-stabilizing effects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to eat a wide variety of vegetables in many colours and shades. The pigment of your plant foods shows what vitamins and minerals it contains. For example, red and orange vegetables tend to be high in vitamin C. Dark green vegetables contain lots of iron. Blue and purple vegetables give you a great dose of antioxidants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some vegetables to try out for tonight\u2019s dinner:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kale<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swiss chard<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lettuce<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carrots<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tomatoes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pumpkin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggplant<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zucchini<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mushrooms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabbage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peppers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean protein<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protein is great for helping you feel full and satisfied after a meal. There are lots of essential bodily processes that couldn\u2019t happen without consuming protein. However, the sources you get your protein from are important. And, lots of people currently over consume protein thinking it\u2019s a healthier option than fats and carbohydrates. The current recommendation for protein consumption is 0.8 grams per kilogram of bodyweight per day, or 10-35% of calories.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some sources of lean protein are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poultry, such as turkey or chicken<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fish and shellfish, such as canned tuna, halibut, scallops, and shrimp<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soy products such as tofu, tempeh, or mock meat<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy fats<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dietary fats are essential for good health. There are certain nutrients, like vitamin A, K, E, and D, that your body can only absorb with the help of fats. Consuming healthy fats also helps you keep a balanced hormonal profile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When crafting your meals, be sure to choose fats that contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Fats that come from plant sources are generally healthiest. Plus, they also provide nutrients like fibre, vitamins, and minerals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples of healthy fat sources:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avocado<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chia seeds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flax seeds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fatty fish, such as salmon and sardines<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nuts such as walnuts and pecans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eggs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olives and olive oil<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canola oil<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsweetened beverages<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tip dietitians often recommend to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PCOS weight loss<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> patients is to avoid drinking their calories. Soda, juice, iced tea, and of course fancy iced coffees can easily contain a full meal\u2019s worth of calories. And, it\u2019s usually in the form of refined sugar, which will drastically spike your blood sugar.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of your beverages as providing hydration rather than sustenance. Hydration is very important for keeping low, stable blood sugar levels. When you\u2019re dehydrated your blood sugar becomes concentrated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next time you need a refreshing sip, try one of these drink options:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water, either plain or flavoured with herbs and citrus.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herbal tea.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sparkling water.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kombucha.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homemade iced tea, without sugar.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods to avoid when you have PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re eating lots of healthy foods, you\u2019ve already made a great start at stabilizing your blood sugar. There are some foods you should try to avoid as much as possible since they\u2019ll counteract your healthful progress. Some items on this list are comfort foods, and you don\u2019t have to cut them out of your life completely. Just make them the occasional treat instead of the foundation of your diet. These foods include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red meat<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processed meat<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solid fats, known as saturated or trans fats<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refined carbs made from white flour, such as pastries and white bread<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battered and\/or fried foods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast food<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweetened beverages such as pop or juice<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the best PCOS diet to lose weight?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re overweight and your doctor has recommended that you lose weight, shedding 5-10% of your bodyweight can have a profoundly beneficial impact on your blood sugars. There\u2019s no fast method of weight loss that will be healthy or sustainable long term. Especially since PCOS is a lifelong condition, doctors recommend their patients take a lifestyle-based approach to weight loss.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight loss is achieved when the number of calories you consume through food is less than the number of calories you burn through exercise and bodily functions. A diet of whole plant foods, lean meat, and healthy fat provides \u201chigh-quality\u201d calories. You\u2019ll feel full and satisfied throughout the day, and will be less likely to require sugary snacks to boost your energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To embrace a lifestyle shift, start with small, healthy acts throughout your day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, snack on fruit instead of potato chips, and practice mental relaxation to deal with stress instead of reaching for comfort food. Whatever you find enjoyable and sustainable will build a new healthy mindset.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A delicious way to manage PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing your diet and lifestyle can seem overwhelming at first. We eat every day, and we have many habits and rituals built around food. A healthy lifestyle is one that complements your preferences and needs. Don\u2019t like lettuce? Have a glazed carrot dish instead. Not a fan of chicken? Maybe fish is the way to go.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diet is a powerful way to regain control over your PCOS. By viewing food as a tool to fuel your body, keep you in good health, and improve your quality of life, you\u2019re on the way to an exemplary PCOS diet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that you consult a medical professional to ensure you\u2019re approaching a new diet in a safe and balanced way.
