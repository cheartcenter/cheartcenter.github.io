We\u2019ve all heard that car accidents increase the day after the spring forward time change \u2014 it\u2019s true. So if one hour less of sleep can make that much of a difference to our driving ability, what else can it do?<\/p>\n<h2>The side effects of sleep deprivation<\/h2>\n<p>According to sleep therapist Aaron Arkin, the effects of sleep deprivation on the brain are widespread. \u201cDaytime performance deficits are obvious: irritability rates go up, concentration declines, workplace accidents increase. All of this leads to absenteeism at work. Lately, I\u2019ve also been hearing a lot about \u2018presenteeism,\u2019 which is when you\u2019re at work, but unable to perform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just our professional lives that suffer. Over time, the health effects of lack of sleep really add up. Cumulative sleep deprivation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK19961\/\">increases our risk<\/a> of developing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/high-blood-pressure-treatment\/\">hypertension<\/a>, diabetes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/obesity-treatment\/\">obesity<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Depression-treatment\">depression<\/a>, heart attack, and stroke. In general, our chances of developing chronic health issues increase, as lack of sleep weakens the immune system\u00a0over time.<\/p>\n<h2>Weird physical symptoms of sleep deprivation<\/h2>\n<p>Our bodies work on internal clocks called \u201ccircadian rhythms,\u201d which is why we feel tired at night and refreshed in the morning (at least in theory). These rhythms also control when different hormones are released, so throwing off our bodies\u2019 internal clock messes with more than just our mood. In fact, just one night of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3734788\/\">sleep deprivation decreases the production of leptin<\/a>, a hormone which suppresses appetite.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disruption to the sleep\/wake pattern also messes with the relationship between our brain and our gut. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2018\/jul\/09\/nightshifts-disrupt-rhythm-between-brain-and-gut\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research shows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that our digestive system is thrown off more quickly by lack of sleep than our brain \u2014 leading the brain to send signals to our stomach at the wrong time. These factors explain why shift work often correlates with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, and why many shift workers complain of digestive issues. This means that\u00a0we end up both hungrier and worse at processing the food we\u2019re likely bingeing on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The psychological effects of sleep deprivation<\/h2>\n<p>While the\u00a0long-term physical symptoms get a lot of coverage, the emotional and mental effects of sleep deprivation can be just as debilitating. One of the most immediate effects lack\u00a0of sleep\u00a0has is on mood. Not getting enough shut-eye messes with our ability to regulate our emotions and increases our irritability. This is why you find yourself snapping at your partner after a bad night, or crying in your cubicle over something minor at work. With regular sleep deprivation you accumulate sleep debt, leading to more pronounced effects.<\/p>\n<p>Lack of sleep and depression often go hand-in-hand. In fact, many mental illnesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/newsletter_article\/sleep-and-mental-health\">correlate<\/a> with difficulty sleeping. Those with bipolar disorder, for example, often experience trouble sleeping, which in turn\u00a0can exacerbate symptoms of their illness.<\/p>\n<h2>The effects of lack of sleep on your brain and body<\/h2>\n<p>The effects of sleep loss are varied, but some of the short and long term effects include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>impaired decision making abilities<\/li>\n<li>slowed reaction time<\/li>\n<li>lowered concentration<\/li>\n<li>increased irritability<\/li>\n<li>impaired immunological functioning<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/obesity-treatment\/\">obesity<\/a><\/li>\n<li>diabetes<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Depression-treatment\">depression<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What is sleep debt?<\/h2>\n<p>Sleep debt is what it sounds like \u2014 the amount of sleep we \u201cowe\u201d our body after a night of not getting enough. If you should be sleeping between seven to nine hours a night but you only get six, you\u2019ve accumulated an hour of sleep debt. Repeat that pattern all week, and your debt balloons to a full night\u2019s worth of sleep. Luckily, you can help to counterbalance that by getting a good night\u2019s sleep until you\u2019re fully rested again.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important not to go overboard in the opposite direction, though, as too much sleep has its own perils. Regularly getting more than nine hours of sleep a night, puts you at higher risk for both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/articles\/what-your-sleep-habits-reveal-about-your-dementia-risk\">dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s<\/a>. Too much sleep has also been linked to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5654282\/\">breast cancer<\/a> \u2014 although the same research suggests this can also result from too little sleep (though less often). So while we all need more sleep from time to time, the sweet spot for most adults is six to nine hours a night. Check out our piece on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-importance-of-sleep-are-you-really-getting-enough\/\">the importance of sleep<\/a> to see how much you should be getting.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatment for lack of sleep<\/h2>\n<p>While sleep difficulties are quite\u00a0common, there are some signs when it might be time to seek professional help. Arkin recommends using the \u201crule of three\u201d when deciding: \u201cIf you\u2019re having trouble sleeping three nights a week and it\u2019s been going on for about three weeks, then it might be time to start thinking about a professional.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Arkin adds, that while sleep disorders have only really been studied for the last 50 years, it seems that\u00a0both insomnia and sleep apnea, have a hereditary component. So if you\u2019re experiencing symptoms and know that a close family member has struggled with either of these difficulties, it\u2019s worth looking into getting help.<\/p>\n<h2>Sleep tips<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re on the fence about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/sleep-therapist\/\">speaking to a professional<\/a> but still feel you need help with your sleep, check out Arkin&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\">top five tips to help you sleep better<\/a> for the best habits to help you sleep better at night<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Our hectic lives often mean that the first thing to end up on the backburner is a proper night\u2019s sleep. Even if we avoid getting into a car accident, lack of sleep does have real consequences. Lowered life satisfaction and weakened interpersonal relationships are just two of the outcomes insomnia can engender. And that&#8217;s without even mentioning the health effects. So stay tuned for the next instalment in our sleep series as we lay out more simple tricks for getting a better night\u2019s sleep.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve all heard that car accidents increase the day after the spring forward time change \u2014 it\u2019s true.
