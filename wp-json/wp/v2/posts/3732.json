While staffing may not seem like the prime candidate for innovation, the ability to create an integrated, national network of physicians can have profound effects on patient care, satisfaction and outcomes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physician recruitment efforts can be costly and time-consuming. This is especially apparent in rural areas, which lack the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cfp.ca\/content\/64\/8\/621\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advantages of urban settings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like schools and employment opportunities for children and spouses of physicians. In some cases, physicians unexpectedly leave, in others they only sign on for temporary or locum placements. Either way, the results are the same \u2014 communities and hospitals lurched into crisis mode over and over. They&#8217;re forced to spend ongoing time and resources on recruitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, we\u2019ve developed a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/canada\/2018\/12\/02\/pei-hospital-tackles-doctor-shortage-through-video-tele-rounding-pilot.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promising solution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 one that aids both rural and urban hospitals alike, opening up innovative opportunities for physicians across the country and most importantly,\u00a0improving patient care. Currently being piloted by our partners at Western Hospital in Alberton PEI, we&#8217;re excited to share the results this Spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you need to know about our tele-rounding platform and how it can work in your hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our platform<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4>Telemedicine functionality designed by doctors, for doctors<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple has designed a tele-rounding platform that allows doctors from other parts of the country to virtually see patients in other areas. The multi-way video doesn\u2019t limit the encounter to just the patient and physician, though. Other care providers like pharmacists and physiotherapists can also join the conversation, making holistic patient care a reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This system also allows for more reliable and complete charting. While speaking with patients, the physician can take notes, review notes from previous days and even send e-prescriptions to any pharmacy in Canada. Notes, interactions and referrals are all stored securely on the patient\u2019s profile. Anything that would have previously been in paper form now takes place on the platform within the patient profile. Digitized patient records also allow charts to be augmented with digital images and sound recordings that demonstrate changes over time. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Secure, flexible and compliant messaging<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication is an issue at any hospital \u2013 the use of outdated technologies like pagers, fax machines and switchboards can lead to critical delays in information, sometimes jeopardizing effective patient care. Recognizing this issue, the UK\u2019s National Neath Service recently decided<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/pheewaterfield\/2018\/12\/13\/mp-hancock-orders-nhs-to-ditch-fax-machines-by-2020\/#5f7410725b23\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to phase out all fax machines in their system by 2020<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Beyond modernizing processes, this will also help prevent security breaches and ensure health care professionals aren\u2019t turning to less secure forms of communication like WhatsApp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intuitive messaging systems like those we use in our everyday lives can greatly increase the efficiency of hospital communications however. The ability to share updates, create tasks, transfer documents and share the most up to date information is invaluable.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why a secure messaging component was built right in to our platform. To allow physicians and hospital staff to communicate effectively in a way that\u2019s fully compliant with HIPAA, PHIPA and other privacy legislation. In addition to being secure, an in-app directory makes collaboration simple by allowing staff to\u00a0message any colleague without needing their phone number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In PEI\u2019s Western Hospital, it is helping to make discharge planning a more streamlined process. Our platform makes it possible for the local care teams to create a \u201cgroup message\u201d to all those involved in the care of a patient. This eliminates the need to spend hours or even days chasing down health care providers to review charts. With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24670166\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 of every 25 hospitalized patients expected to develop a hospital-associated infection,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0being diligent about length of stay and discharge planning is a no-brainer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What sets us apart?<\/h2>\n<h4>Process mapping for efficient workflow<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating new technology into existing systems can be complex \u2013 often in health care, new technologies boast the ability to simplify or modernize processes but the implementations fall short. Technologies are layered one upon another, forcing front-line workers to use multiple programs and struggle to adapt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key component of our implementation is a deep dive into the existing hospital processes. This enables us to fully integrate our technology without duplicative steps. This, in turn, leads to patient and provider satisfaction and superior care. We work hand-in-hand with staff to ensure a smooth onboarding, including tailored training sessions, a train-the-trainer model, instructional materials and more. We don\u2019t just deliver the software and walk away, we work with the care and administration teams, every step of the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Flexible platform, custom implementation<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With innovative features and custom implementations, we see endless possibilities for this technology. It&#8217;s already evolving from its initial purpose as a\u00a0tele-rounding platform, integrating new features. As we continue to implement it in new hospitals, each with their own unique situation, we&#8217;ll continue to evolve the software to address new problems and barriers. We&#8217;re excited to continue on this road of innovation and see it as the best way to make health care sustainable in the years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Physician staffing in hospitals has seen minimal change in past decades, despite the insurgence of innovations in other areas of health care.
