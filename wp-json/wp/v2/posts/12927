It\u2019s how we see our friends, structure our days, and feel productive and included.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, things are different when you\u2019re working through a pandemic. Suddenly, your staff have been isolated. They\u2019ve converted the living room to their office, with their kids running around and unplugging the printer. They\u2019re handling the great unknown \u2014 how will the pandemic turn out? Will things ever go back to normal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important as an employer to be mindful of these conditions and the impact they\u2019re making on your employees\u2019 mental health. You can do a lot to create a positive, supportive working environment. In return, your employees will feel more emotionally secure and invested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow these tips to align priorities on employee mental health, and make accommodations so everyone can do their best work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Be empathetic<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in supporting your employees is by simply being aware of current factors they\u2019re facing. Remote workers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/minda-zetlin\/remote-work-employees-burnout-zillow-founder-rich-barton.html?cid=cp01002fastco&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">face burnout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at higher levels than in-office workers tend to. That\u2019s in normal times, let alone with news headlines and social media painting a grim picture of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote workers also tend to grapple with loneliness, even if they&#8217;re attending lots of virtual meetings. Loneliness is bad for our health. Social isolation and loneliness <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/loneliness-health-effects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have been proven<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to lead to premature death, at even higher rates than vices like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2019\/05\/ce-corner-isolation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drinking or smoking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Loneliness can also exacerbate mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you don\u2019t have the power to stop the COVID-19 virus, you do have the power to be empathetic with your staff. Keep this in mind as you assign deadlines, give feedback, and communicate with your employees. A little understanding can go a long way.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Think out-of-the-box for socials<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because everyone is physical distancing, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have fun together! But, you\u2019ll want to avoid the standard \u201cvideo cocktail party\u201d format. People are tired of either talking over each other, or enduring long, awkward silences. Luckily, there\u2019s a better way to plan social events.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Games are here to save the day. There are lots of online versions of popular board games, card games, and quiz games that will keep a crowd laughing for hours. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pocket-lint.com\/apps\/news\/152034-the-best-games-to-play-on-zoom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a great list of games you can play over video call.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also watch live shows, lead a cooking class, host a talent competition, or any number of ideas you might otherwise plan for a work social. Check out your local community for virtual events. After all, the show must go on for every industry. Many local arts collectives are staying connected to their communities over streaming services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Check in with employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t ask your employees how they\u2019re doing, they might not tell you until it\u2019s too late and burnout has already set in. Schedule regular meetings with your staff to ask them how they\u2019re coping with things. The chance to talk openly and honestly can be very cathartic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/employee-performance.com\/blog\/a-managers-checklist-for-employee-check-ins\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a handy checklist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for employee check-ins. While you\u2019re asking about their workloads, also ask how they\u2019re mentally handling current circumstances. Some people feel pressure to put on a brave face, and never end up sharing real fears and anxieties they\u2019ve been harbouring. Check-ins should be a safe space for employees to vent, and seek help if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Provide mental health resources<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee check-ins are essential, but they can\u2019t replace the help of a mental health professional. Our mental health is something we maintain on a daily basis by practicing relaxation, reaching out to friends and family, and keeping up healthy habits. You can help your employees take care of their minds by providing educational resources, and access to mental healthcare providers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccmhs-ccsms.ca\/mental-health-resources-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a consolidated landing page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canada-wide mental health resources. As well as mental first aid tools, you can share <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/how-to-protect-your-familys-mental-health-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blogs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tips, and inspiration to help with daily mental health maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a great idea for your employees to speak to a therapist in the midst of these stressful times. Therapists help patients process difficult emotions, develop coping skills, and feel better within themselves. Now that everyone is anxious at home, there\u2019s a lot to unpack with a therapist. This isn\u2019t something you can mandate, but sharing details on online therapy is a great way to encourage employees to seek help from the comfort of home if they need it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Encourage work-life balance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With remote working arrangements, it can feel like the workday never really ends. We\u2019re always attached to our devices, so maybe just one more email, one more phone call, one more task.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way that employees can lessen their anxiety is by having clear structure in their days. If your staff is on a 9-5 schedule, ensure that meetings don\u2019t occur before or after those hours. Let employees know that they\u2019re allowed to take breaks for lunch, to go for a walk, or to attend to situations with their families. Don\u2019t expect employees to be available 24\/7.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the home is also the office, it can be hard to find mental separation. Communicate expectations clearly \u2014 employees are free to enjoy their off-time, and should not feel compelled to be responsive and productive round the clock.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Promote healthy habits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our physical health goes hand in hand with our mental health. Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help you sleep better, reduce rates of chronic illness, and manage symptoms of anxiety and depression.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try organizing a department or company-wide exercise event, such as a jog for charity, a cardio challenge, or a group yoga class. Exercise releases serotonin, which is the \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical in our brains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good nutrition <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nutritionist-resource.org.uk\/articles\/stress.html#stressanddiet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does wonders<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for stress too. A healthy diet helps bolster your immune system, which keeps disease at bay and makes you feel energized. It also boosts your gut health, and ensures you\u2019re topped up on vitamins and nutrients. You can help your employees make wholesome food choices by leading a healthy online cooking class, or delivering whole foods treats to their homes rather than cakes or donuts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Reward good work<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What keeps us going in the short term is the feeling of teamwork, and of being valued by our peers. Make sure you give recognition to your employees for good work to keep up their team spirit and motivation, even if you\u2019re miles apart.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to maintain a positive mental attitude all the time, let alone during a period of global unrest. Having open, honest, and vulnerable conversations can help everyone feel like they\u2019re on the same transparent page. And, it will go a long way in helping employees feel more supported, connected, and empowered by their employer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health is something we all share, but not enough people get professional help for their problems. Online therapy is a growing solution. Patients can see a licensed therapist whenever they want, from the comfort of their own homes.
