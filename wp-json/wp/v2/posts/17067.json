This leaves many parents wondering if they should be introducing potential food allergens to their little ones right now. Luckily, the Canadian Pediatric Society has clear guidelines on this. According to them, there\u2019s \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cps.ca\/en\/blog-blogue\/can-we-continue-to-recommend-early-allergenic-food-introduction-during-a-pandemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never been a death due to first ingestion of an allergenic food in infancy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d In other words, parents can give their kids potentially allergenic foods as long as they do it safely. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to keep your child safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What causes food allergies in babies?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergic reactions happen when your immune system misidentifies a harmless substance (like eggs) as a threat. This causes the body to release chemicals called histamines, which trigger an immune response. So it\u2019s actually your body\u2019s own immune response causing the allergy symptoms like swelling and hives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know there\u2019s a hereditary component to allergies because children with a parent or sibling with one are more likely to have an allergy too. But just because you\u2019re allergic to shellfish, doesn\u2019t mean your child will be. Researchers think that epigenetics play a role in who develops allergies. In other words, you can have the genes for an allergy, but if certain environmental factors don\u2019t \u201cturn on\u201d those genes, you won\u2019t end up with one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to tell if your baby has allergies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergies can show up in a few different ways. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonal allergies in babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toddlers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often cause watery eyes or runny noses, for example. But <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nasal allergy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> symptoms in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t just indicate seasonal issues. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infant food allergies <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can affect <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s eyes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 making them <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/healthy-eating\/reducing-baby-food-allergy-risk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water and itch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as causing runny nose. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pet allergies in babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often show up this way as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hives and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rashes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can signal <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby allergies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. These show up for all sorts of allergic reactions \u2014 from mild laundry detergent allergies to an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts. But there are a whole bunch of allergy symptoms you might see in your little one \u2014 more on this below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Allergy symptoms in babies and toddlers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergy symptoms are varied and can range from mild to severe. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vomiting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diarrhea<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloody stool<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swelling of the lips and mouth<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wheezing\/trouble breathing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hives\/rash<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eczema<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cough<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itchy, watery eyes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Runny nose<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pale face<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue lips and\/or face<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing consciousness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What is anaphylaxis?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can look a little different depending on the child, from swelling in the lips and face to laboured breathing. In other cases, your child\u2019s lips can take on a\u00a0 bluish tinge and they may become sleepy. This is just as severe as it\u2019s a sign that their blood isn\u2019t getting enough oxygen. Anaphylaxis is always a medical emergency.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can I prevent allergies in my child?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, not entirely. But you may be able to lower their risk of developing one. For starters, doctors recommend <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/ask-a-lactation-consultant-your-breastfeeding-questions-answered\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your child (if possible) as it may <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/healthy-eating\/reducing-baby-food-allergy-risk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decrease their risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for developing allergies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when it comes to introducing food allergens to kids, the thinking has changed over the years. Doctors used to tell parents to hold off on giving allergens like peanuts until age one. But evidence now shows that kids should eat potentially allergenic foods early and often. This means that it\u2019s ok to feed them to your baby starting at about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cps.ca\/en\/documents\/position\/allergenic-solids\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And don\u2019t just do it once. Allergy Canada recommends you continue giving them to your baby <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/foodallergycanada.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/FAC_EarlyIntro_4pager_May2020_Web.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two to three times a week<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make sure they don\u2019t develop an allergy over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Toddlers and food allergies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">common allergies in toddlers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are: milk, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish and fish, eggs, wheat and soy. Because things like oysters aren\u2019t a common baby food in Canada, you might not realize your child has an allergy until they become a toddler. The good news is that many children <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/food-allergies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outgrow their milk, wheat, egg or soy allergy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Peanut and shellfish allergies, however, don\u2019t usually go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Treating allergic reactions in babies and toddlers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can\u2019t take <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergy medicine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but parents can use an over-the-counter (OTC) medication like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for children over two. But if your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toddler<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hasn\u2019t taken <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allergy medicine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before, check with their pediatrician first. It\u2019s a good idea to connect with their doctor each time your child has an allergic reaction to something new anyway. Reactions can increase in severity at each exposure \u2014 and can even progress from mild to anaphylactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child does have an anaphylactic allergy to something, they will need an epipen. In this case, you must administer the epipen as soon as you notice signs of an anaphylactic reaction and then dial 9-1-1. Always take your child to the hospital after they receive their epipen, even if they seem to recover fully.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is there a cure for allergies?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no cure for allergies, but therapies such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/stanmed.stanford.edu\/2014fall\/i-can-eat-it.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">immunotherapy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help to treat them. Immunotherapy involves exposing allergy sufferers to microscopic doses of their allergen and gradually increasing the dosage over time as their immune response lessens. This can only be done safely in a clinical setting by doctors and should never be attempted on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergic reactions are scary. But research shows us that introducing potential allergens instead of keeping our children in a food bubble is actually safer. If you\u2019re still feeling nervous, you can always take your little one to the local hospital\u2019s parking lot for their first taste of peanut butter. And as always, speak to your child\u2019s doctor if you have any concerns. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wondering if you should be introducing potential food allergens to your little ones?
