But so much of our health is simmering below the surface, formed by our daily lifestyle habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronic diseases, many of which are preventable, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/disease-prevention\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are the leading<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cause of death and disability. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/disease-prevention\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% of healthcare dollars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are spent treating conditions like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Often when our health is worsening, there are telltale signs your body gives. If you notice any of the following symptoms it might be time to reexamine your diet, check your stress levels, or see a doctor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Your nails are an odd colour or texture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turns out, your nails are the window to your health. They\u2019ll take on all sorts of colours depending on the state of your internal wellbeing. Here\u2019s what to watch out for, depending on the colour of your nails.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pale or white: anemia, nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, diabetes, and overactive thyroid.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yellow: lung disease, Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, thyroid problems, rheumatoid arthritis.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red nail beds: heart disease.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue or purple: cyanosis, circulatory system disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thin brown or red lines: fungal infection, melanoma, psoriasis, heart infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horizontal lines: mental stress, Raynaud\u2019s disease, zinc deficiency.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitted or split: psoriasis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroid disease.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark lines or patches under the nail: melanoma.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These signs are worrying if they don\u2019t coincide with a recent injury. If you\u2019ve accidentally hammered your thumb, or stubbed your toe, some discoloration is just a sign of minor trauma and is not a deeper medical concern.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. You\u2019re always tired<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTired.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel like you\u2019re always dragging yourself through the day, there could be an underlying condition. It\u2019s normal to feel tired sometimes, especially given stress, hormonal shifts, and even the weather. But persistent fatigue that gets in the way of daily life might be a sign you need medical attention. Here are some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/248002#symptoms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possible causes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of chronic tiredness.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depression: fatigue is a common symptom of clinical depression. Depression also can cause side-effects like insomnia, which worsens fatigue.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep apnea: people with sleep apnea may think they\u2019re sleeping eight hours a night, so why don\u2019t they feel refreshed in the morning? That\u2019s because sleep apnea causes you to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/sleep-apnea\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20377631#:~:text=Daytime%20fatigue.,TV%20or%20even%20when%20driving.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wake up repeatedly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout the night, interrupting restorative sleep.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too little physical activity: who knew that exercising could actually give you more energy? The fitter you are, the more strength and energy you have to complete tasks. The reverse is true for poor fitness levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asthma: side-effects of asthma can lead to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/asthma.net\/living\/is-fatigue-a-symptom-of-asthma\/#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20cause%20of,persists%20for%20the%20asthmatic%20patient.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">low blood oxygen levels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which leaves you feeling tired.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypothyroidism: this condition causes underactivity with your thyroid gland, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-weird-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism-you-might-be-missing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">often resulting in fatigue and brain fog<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Unintentional weight gain or loss<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s completely normal to fluctuate in your weight. As we get older, we generally tend to gain weight because of a slowed metabolism, decreased physical activity, and lack of insight into nutrition. But when you\u2019ve found you\u2019ve gained or lost weight without an apparent cause, it\u2019s time to investigate further. Your doctor might look for one of these underlying conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/weight-gain-unintentional#treatment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluid retention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: sometimes a sign of heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/324872#insomnia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insomnia:<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when we get poor sleep, we tend to overeat as our body craves an energy source.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/thyroid-disease-the-symptoms-you-need-to-know-about\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thyroid disorder:<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> slowed metabolism and fluid retention is a side-effect.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/unexplained-weight-loss#muscleloss\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer:<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the first symptoms is unexplained weight loss of ten pounds or more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflammatory bowel disease: chronic bowel inflammation is energy-intensive for your body. Plus, IBD can disrupt ghrelin, the hunger and satiety hormone.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muscle loss: if you lose muscle, you\u2019ll lose weight.

Extreme hunger or thirst<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people joke about having a bottomless pit for a stomach. It\u2019s normal to feel starving after a long day of work, or feel thirst on a hot summer day. When hunger and thirst take over your life, there might be a more concerning medical issue at play.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diabetes: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.endocrineweb.com\/conditions\/type-2-diabetes\/type-2-diabetes-symptoms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relentless hunger and thirst<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are common symptoms of type two diabetes. For diabetics, their bodies pull fluid from their tissues to dilute their blood and counteract high glucose levels. And, diabetics can\u2019t get glucose energy from their food due to insulin resistance. The body will keep sending hunger signals, trying to get more energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of sleep: when you\u2019re underslept, your body will crave the next best energy source, food.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dehydration: your body might mix up hunger and thirst cues if you\u2019re dehydrated. Many people will reach for snack after snack, only to find their cravings subside after a glass of water.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thyroid problems: if you\u2019re eating constantly but still seem to be losing weight, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/constantly-hungry-but-losing-weight-your-thyroid-might-be-to-blame\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might be to blame. Overactivity of your thyroid gland can also bring on anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and general weakness.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Bloating after eating<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone bloats, especially after a heavy meal. Even after a light lunch, it\u2019s still normal for your abdomen to expand to digest your food. But bloating that\u2019s noticeable, uncomfortable, and predictable after eating anything at all could be a sign of gastrointestinal issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irritable bowel syndromes: IBS leads to a spastic digestive system. People with this condition often experience a cycle of constipation and diarrhea.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heartburn: bloating and heartburn have similar contributing factors. Eating too quickly, drinking fizzy drinks, or eating heavy, fatty, or spicy foods can cause both heartburn and bloating.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/allergy\/do-my-food-allergies-make-me-look-fat.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food intolerance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: allergies and intolerances to certain foods can cause gas and bloating. They can also create widespread inflammation throughout your body.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Painful or burning urination<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A burning sensation when you pee is most commonly commonly caused by bacterial infection of the urinary tract. This can result from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/std-vs-sti\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-story-of-kelly-and-the-uti-she-had-no-time-for\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">urinary tract infections (UTIs)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you\u2019re feeling the heat when you pee, speak to a doctor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many facets to our health that keeping track of everything can seem overwhelming. The good news is, you don\u2019t have to be a medical doctor to take care of your own health. Health is built by small, consistent decisions, like choosing a veggie bowl over poutine, or going on an evening jog instead of binging a season of the newest docu-series.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re experiencing strange symptoms and want to talk to a doctor, you can speak to one online. Our doctors can connect with you in under two minutes, so there\u2019s no need to ponder those burning health questions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s tricky to know if you should see a doctor for strange symptoms.
