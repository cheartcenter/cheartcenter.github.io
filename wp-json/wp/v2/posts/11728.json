There\u2019s no toilet paper on the shelves, schools are closed, and if you work in any industry involving crowds, you\u2019re likely wondering how you\u2019re going to pay your bills. On top of that, you\u2019re at home with your kids for another few weeks (or longer). No one wants to spread the coronavirus, but watching continuous TV at home isn\u2019t too appealing either. There\u2019s probably no better way to throw your anxiety into overdrive. So what\u2019s a concerned parent supposed to do? Let\u2019s start with the facts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does COVID-19 affect kids?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about the novel coronavirus. So far though, it seems like kids are better off than adults when they do get COVID-19. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/specific-groups\/children-faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symptoms of COVID-19 in kids<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> typically look like a cold and they might get a fever and\/or cough. And unlike adults, cases of children becoming seriously ill or dying are extremely rare.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a caveat though \u2014 kids can spread the virus, even before they exhibit any symptoms, just like adults. And those they spread it to (like their grandparents) may not be as resilient. Especially if they&#8217;re immunocompromised, over 60, or have certain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jama\/fullarticle\/2762130\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pre existing conditions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So while your kids will probably be fine if they contract COVID-19, the same can\u2019t be said for those they interact with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Does coronavirus mean no playdates?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to lock yourself inside your house, but the rules of social distancing still apply to the outdoors. If you\u2019re out for a walk, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the CDC recommends keeping at least <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/about\/steps-when-sick.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six feet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> away from others in public (about half a car length away). But social distancing extends to more than just that. Kids are notorious germ spreaders, and a bunch of them in one place right now isn\u2019t such a hot idea. Unfortunately, this means play dates and playgrounds are a no-go. Virtual playdates, riding bikes or a family walk are better options. But if you or your kids are sick at all, self-isolating at home is a must. There\u2019s no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, so limiting social interactions and hand washing are our only weapons for preventing its spread right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What if I need to talk to a doctor?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you or your kids need to see a doctor, it\u2019s likely weighing on your mind. The last place you want to take your kids is into an area where many people may be sick \u2014 even if there aren\u2019t reported cases of coronavirus in your community. So what\u2019s a parent to do? There\u2019s a few options.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This should go without saying, but if you\u2019re having a medical emergency, you have to call 911 right away. Don\u2019t delay this because of fears over coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you live in BC and you have a non-urgent need (think getting a prescription refill, treating infections like pink eye or just getting medical advice), your medical services plan (MSP) will cover virtual doctor\u2019s visits over video. More on how this works <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/msp-and-virtual-healthcare\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of BC, you can also see a doctor online. Note that this isn\u2019t covered by most provincial insurance plans, so there is usually a fee unless you have coverage through your employer or HSA.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Ontario, OHIP now covers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online COVID-19 screening<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can talk to a doctor about any symptoms and possible next steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping your kids occupied for the next while is definitely going to require more creative thinking than usual. But while it may seem like a headache now, it&#8217;ll pay off in the long run. Wash your hands as soon as you get home and after touching any communal surfaces (doorknobs, toilet handles, etc), and make sure everyone in your household is following these precautions too. If you have relatives in a high risk demographic, the best way to show your love right now is by avoiding them for a bit. Community behaviour is the most important factor in helping us get this under control and the buck stops with you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems like COVID-19
