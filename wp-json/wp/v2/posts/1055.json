Not only that, but when she actually\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need to pee, it feels more like blades than liquid. It sucks, and Kelly has no time to deal with the normal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/urinary-tract-infection-treatment\/\">UTI<\/a> treatment processes that she usually goes through. She needs to work on her urgent presentation for the rest of the day, and can\u2019t dedicate a whole day to go to the clinic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly is worried, uncomfortable, and in desperate need of relief. Her only wish at the moment is to get back to work so she can prepare to \u2018wow\u2019 her audience with her presentation in the morning. \u00a0She calls her close friend Susan asking if there is any way to shortcut the lines at the clinic. But when Susan runs out of options, she asks Kelly a question: Have you tried an online doctor? Like a doctor you can talk to on your phone without going to the clinic? \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With hopes of getting fast relief, Kelly quickly hops online, inputs her symptoms, and the hours she could have been waiting in a clinic are down to just a few minutes before she\u2019s talking to a doctor. Kelly is able to receive medical diagnosis and treatment, all from the comfort of her office. The doctor makes sure that what she\u2019s experiencing is a typical UTI by asking about the frequency she experiences them, as well as any other symptoms that might be indicators of a more serious issue. But no, Kelly just needs fast help with her irritating run-of-the-mill UTI so she can get back to preparing her presentation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doctor tells her not to worry, she can order a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/features\/online-prescriptions\/\">prescription<\/a> for some antibiotics right away for pickup from her local pharmacy, or delivery to her home. Since it seems like a simple UTI, there are a lot of options for oral antibiotics that can help fast.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugs.com\/article\/antibiotics-for-uti.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bactrim, Sepra, Augmentin, Macrobid<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and others are all options depending on a patient\u2019s past health and allergies. Once she\u2019s off the call, Kelly is relieved that she is able to get the relief she needs in less time than it would have taken her just to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drive<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the clinic. She gets back to work knowing that she\u2019s going to have fast relief and be ready for her presentation in the morning!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get help fast when you need it, so you don\u2019t miss life\u2019s most important moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While trying to get through her work day, she can&#8217;t focus because of the excruciating pain and pressure she is feeling in her lower abdomen, along with the constant urge to pee.
