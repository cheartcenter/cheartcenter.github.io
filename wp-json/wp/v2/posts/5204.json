And those of us who do\u00a0register aren\u2019t always disclosing that information to our families. Not sharing your status with your family means that when the time comes to donate, it may not happen. Some countries such as Spain operate on a presumed consent system. This means that\u00a0they consider everyone to be an organ donor unless they explicitly state otherwise. In Canada, however, we currently\u00a0have an explicit consent system, meaning that you need to deliberately choose to be a donor. New legislation in Nova Scotia will make the province the first in North America to use a presumed consent system in the next 12-18 months.<\/p>\n<p>You can register to be an organ donor once you reach the age of majority in Canada, but how you do that depends on where you live. The Canadian government provides a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/healthy-living\/blood-organ-tissue-donation.html#a2\">handy guide<\/a>\u00a0for you to follow the process, as it differs province to province. Unless you are a living donor, you won\u2019t be there to speak to hospital staff about what you want. This means that after you register, your second step must be to inform family members and loved ones that you are a registered donor and wish to donate your organs.<\/p>\n<h3>What organs can you donate?<\/h3>\n<p>Many of us think that\u00a0we can only be an organ donor if we die, but that isn\u2019t true. There are three ways that you can donate in Canada: after neurological determination of death (also known as being \u201cbrain dead&#8221;); through donation after circulatory death (which means the patient\u2019s heart has stopped beating); and as a living donor. If you are a registered organ donor and your family gives consent on your behalf, once you are deceased, all healthy organs may be transplanted to those in need who are a match.<\/p>\n<p>As a living organ donor, you can give away certain organs or parts of your organs. Living donors can gift a lobe of their lung, part of their liver, pancreas or intestine, or a kidney. Many who choose to\u00a0become living donors do so to help a family member or loved one who is sick. Sometimes, unfortunately, they aren\u2019t a match. In these cases, Canadian Blood Services runs a program allowing you to register as a pair with your loved one. This program lets you and your loved one donate in a pool with other pairs. This way you can donate to someone unknown who\u00a0is in need, while your loved one can also be matched to a donor.<\/p>\n<h3>Tissue donation facts<\/h3>\n<p>Organs are not the only part of you that\u00a0you can donate after death. Transplanted tissues are also critical in many different cases. Donated tissue such as skin, tendons, eyes and even heart valves can make the difference between life and death for those in need. And because there aren\u2019t the same physical restrictions as there are with organs, tissue donors can potentially help dozens of people. It\u2019s also possible to donate tissue as a living donor. Many have heard of bone marrow transplants, which is one example, but giving blood is also a tissue donation. And given that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/healthy-living\/blood-organ-tissue-donation.html#a2\">more than half<\/a> of Canadians say that either they or a family member has needed blood at some point\u00a0in their life, we all have a stake in maintaining the blood supply.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re comfortable with becoming an organ donor or not, it\u2019s crucial to learn about the life-saving results that organ donation provides. Death can be a difficult subject, and the idea of\u00a0organ donation might make you squeamish, but many families of donors say that it has helped them immeasurably in the grieving process, to know that organs given by their loved ones have helped others to live. So it\u2019s worth spending some time thinking about what you might want for yourself, and speaking to your loved ones about their wishes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Organ donation saves lives, but many Canadians haven\u2019t registered as a donor.
