These are all signs of cognitive decline. For many, they\u2019re an annoying but natural aspect of aging. For others, they\u2019re an early sign of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases that affect your brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, the brain is dynamic. Neuroplasticity means that our minds are flexible. We can improve our mental abilities and slow down degenerative disease through training. By making behavioural changes and healthier lifestyle choices, we can keep our minds firing on all cylinders long into old age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans are complex, but many powerful health measures are simple. Below, we\u2019ve listed some habits and techniques that are proven to ward off cognitive decline in your golden years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise daily<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise doesn\u2019t need to involve daily workout sessions and a gruelling weight-lifting regimen. Studies show that just a little bit of daily exercise goes a long way in protecting your mental acumen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3072565\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study on 165 older adults<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that higher cardiovascular fitness was associated with improved performance on spatial memory tasks. Another study looked at 124 adults aged 60 to 75 years who underwent a 6-month walking and flexibility training program. The results showed that the walking group <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3951958\/#R109\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performed significantly better at cognitive control<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tasks at the end of the study. These findings prove that you don\u2019t need to go nuts in the gym to see big mental results.\u00a0 Instead, you can start with a daily walking routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read nightly<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reading every night provides tons of mental benefits. Reading habitually is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6171467\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">associated with a high level of cognitive ability<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout your lifetime. Plus, the same study suggests that frequent reading can protect against old-age cognitive decline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t necessarily have to read before bed, of course, but doing so has the dual benefit of easing you into a good night\u2019s sleep. This brings us to the next habit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get eight hours of sleep each night<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A poor night\u2019s sleep takes a toll on your cognitive ability the morning after. If you need any more evidence, a study found that every hour of reduced sleep was associated with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4098802\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.67% decline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in cognitive performance. Quality shut-eye leads to improved cognitive performance and can slow down age-related brain atrophy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior citizens are also more <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3677172\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at risk for obstructive sleep apnea<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which interrupts cognitive processes. Visit a doctor or a sleep specialist if you find that you\u2019re chronically tired, even if you\u2019ve slept a full eight hours. It might be that your breathing is suffering overnight.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Play brain games<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies show that we can protect ourselves against age-related decline by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3622463\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">playing cognitive training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> games. When older adults were tasked with playing brain games for 90 days, the study found increased brain volume and lasting changes in neural activity afterward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to neuroplasticity, playing mentally-stimulating games like Sudoku can help keep your mind active and youthful in old age. Playing games is like a mental workout session. Over time you\u2019ll get fitter and will find mental puzzles even more enjoyable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never stop learning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re never too old to learn new things. Taking online courses through EdX, Coursera, Udemy, or a college or university can help keep your mind active at any age. Another option is to learn a foreign language, either through self-learning, a private tutor, or group classes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Language learning is an excellent self-study option that can enrich your life while traveling in your retirement years. Wouldn\u2019t you like to connect with the locals at your beachfront getaway, or chat with the bartender in his native tongue? Learning a foreign language gives you the chance to get a deeper travel experience and exercise your brain at the same time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat a nutritious diet<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your diet plays a major role in your mental performance later in life. A diet rich in antioxidants, folates, fatty acids, and B vitamins <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4758517\/#:~:text=Existing%20evidence%20from%20observational%20studies,the%20majority%20of%20observational%20studies.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduces the risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of stroke, dementia, and cognitive impairment with age. If you need help making better dietary choices, consider speaking with a dietitian or naturopath.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try supplements<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to get a full supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and health-boosting superfoods through our diets every day. Fortunately, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3311304\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies have shown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that certain health supplements can assist in preventing age-related decline, including:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamins B6, B9, and B12<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamins E and D<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omega-3 fatty acids<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ginseng<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before taking a new health supplement, you should first visit a physician or naturopathic doctor as many supplements can interfere with medications you may be currently taking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick up a new hobby<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re creatures of habit. When hobbies ingrain as habits, they eventually shape the course of our lives. Daily hobbies can provide the physical or mental challenge you need to leap out of bed and take on the day with pep in your step. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2646000\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study of 303 elderly people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that increased leisure activities helped with healthy cognitive aging, and can prevent depression later in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gardening, swimming, creative writing, or playing a musical instrument are a few ideas you can try out. Once you find something you enjoy, try committing to it for 90 days and notice the positive differences it makes in your life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay sharp, see a professional<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no better preventative medicine than taking care of your body and stimulating your mind every day. Neuroplasticity, healthy habit formation, sleep, and nutrition can help preserve the healthy function of your body and minds as you age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes even our best efforts aren\u2019t enough to fight off cognitive decline. If your cognitive abilities have slipped, consider visiting a naturopath or functional medicine practitioner. It\u2019s never too late to make a change for the better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your brain is your window to the world.
