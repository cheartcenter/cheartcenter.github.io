Our first stop was our therapy partner, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shiftcollab.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shift Collab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This type of stress is something they\u2019ve certainly seen a time or two. Therapist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vivian Zhang explained,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Financial stress can be scary because it can activate our catastrophic thinking.\u201d This means that our minds automatically start thinking about the worst-case scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address this, Zhang recommends you \u201ccheck and see what your financial status is. It might be helpful to create a financial status log where you write down how much money you currently have, what you owe, what supports might be available\u2026Payment options can be explored with companies you owe money to (such as asking for a payment plan), or you can check in with a financial planner about potential financial plans.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A financial status check is a great first step towards a good night\u2019s sleep, but there can be more than stress leading to your difficulty sleeping. Physical distancing has changed how most of us are living our lives, and according to our top sleep therapist, Aaron Arkin, routine is key to a good night\u2019s sleep. Here are his top five tips to get the best sleep possible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Respect the function of your bed: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ther than getting busy, and getting some shut-eye, there\u2019s nothing else you should be doing in your bed. There\u2019s no need to start answering emails or jumping on Slack for one last look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pay attention to your sleep environment: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our bodies much prefer a cool space. Nocturnal lowering of our body temperature is associated with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3427038\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">production of melatonin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is one of our body\u2019s cues that it\u2019s time to go night-night (it\u2019s called thermoregulation). Keeping your sleep environment quiet, cool and clean is key to a good night\u2019s sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Have a soothing pre-bedtime routine: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever sleep trained a baby, you\u2019ll know how important this is. A bedtime routine cues our brain that we\u2019re winding down, and it\u2019s important to make it as calming as possible. Stick to the same actions in the same order each night. Don\u2019t read on a screen, though \u2014 you\u2019ve heard it many times before, screen time should end an hour before bedtime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Make pro-sleep lifestyle adjustments: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one\u2019s suggesting you reconfigure your life around sleeping but consider small practical changes. Move your afternoon coffee to earlier in the day. Try to take time to walk outside, since getting enough sunlight is crucial. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/taking-care-of-your-physical-and-mental-health-through-covid-19\/\">don\u2019t forget to exercise<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s the best way to help yourself to a better night\u2019s sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Develop an overall routine: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While those weekend sleep-in sessions can be delicious, they can mess up your circadian rhythms. Sticking to the same wake up and bedtime each day means your body knows what\u2019s coming next. If you do have a late night and have trouble keeping it together the next morning, your best bet is to try a short (20 to 40 minute) power nap. Sticking to a regular routine all week keeps you from having to prop yourself up with three million cups of coffee to make it through the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s completely natural to feel anxious and concerned these days, remember that you\u2019re not in this alone. You have thousands of resources, including therapists, financial advisors, doctors, and your personal network of friends and family ready to help you. And we\u2019re all just a few clicks or a phone call away.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a recent survey, 30% of Canadians admitted to losing sleep over money.
