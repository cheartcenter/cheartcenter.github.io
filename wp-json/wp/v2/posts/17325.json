Normally, people across Canada would be boarding flights to visit loved ones, or preparing to host friends and family. This year is different. Canadian cities will be in varying stages of lockdown in the coming weeks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we keep each other&#8217;s health top-of-mind, here\u2019s how you can make your festivities both social and safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Find outdoor activities<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor activities are a great way to see loved ones while lowering the risk of contracting COVID-19. When you speak, cough, or sneeze, small particles of liquid called respiratory droplets exit through your mouth and nose.You can contract the virus by inhaling the respiratory droplets of an infected person. Outdoor spaces have more air flow, making it <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/being-outdoors-doesnt-mean-youre-safe-from-covid-19-a-white-house-event-showed-what-not-to-do-147756\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">harder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for you to inhale other people&#8217;s respiratory droplets when you&#8217;re outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of other health benefits to getting outside. Since we\u2019ve been spending so much time at home, we\u2019re moving our bodies less. Hiking, ice skating, or a simple walk through the park can have positive physical and mental health effects. Try inviting a friend to meet you outside. You can get moving and spend some quality time together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even outside, it\u2019s possible for COVID-19 to spread. Wearing masks, using hand sanitizer, and staying six feet apart are still important.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Make new traditions with kids<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holiday traditions are something every child looks forward to. This year brings opportunities to form new traditions while prioritizing your family\u2019s health. Try making hand-crafted greeting cards, booking a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/lifestyle\/santa-photos-with-children-will-be-different-this-year-canadian-malls-say-1.5171044\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual Santa visit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or dropping off baked goods for your neighbours.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have long-standing traditions you can partake in safely, go for it. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmho.org\/talking-to-your-anxious-child-about-covid-19\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Routine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an important aspect of kids\u2019 mental health. Be sure to talk with your children about your holiday changes. That will help them know what to expect, and you can characterize the changes in a positive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Bring family traditions to your elderly relatives<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since elderly folks are more susceptible to COVID-19 complications, in-person reunions aren\u2019t safe. However, there are ways to include your older relatives without putting them at risk. If they can\u2019t be with you in-person, consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making their favourite dishes and delivering them to their home in advance.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizing a family video call.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recording a holiday greeting and sharing it with your elderly relative.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropping off hand-written cards.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Organize virtual hangouts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A virtual party is a great way to have safe holiday fun. Plan a call with your friends or family, just like you\u2019d plan a party. Decorate your space, dress up, and enjoy each other&#8217;s company!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A virtual hangout could <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2921311\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help minimize<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stress and anxiety for you and your loved ones. Social support builds our resilience. Especially for people who are spending the holidays alone, virtual events are a safe opportunity to enjoy the mental benefits of interpersonal bonds.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Use snail mail<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending snail mail is a novelty these days, and it\u2019s the ideal time to get back into the habit for two reasons. First, creative outlets like writing and drawing can be used as part of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/ca\/blog\/urban-survival\/201803\/mindfulness-art-therapy-can-reduce-depression-and-anxiety\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mindfulness practice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These activities require gentle concentration, keeping you grounded in the present moment and slowing down racing thoughts. This practice, over time, helps <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/-\/media\/files\/community-resource-sheets\/mindfulness-resources-pdf.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=45DAB3C25F20F91FECF84DC3C08B63F125E00577\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> symptoms of depression and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, sending packages in the mail is a very safe way to spread cheer. The likelihood of COVID-19 transmission from handling mail is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost.ca\/cpc\/en\/our-company\/news-and-media\/corporate-news\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-faq.page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">low.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Enjoy your neighbourhood light displays<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light displays are a hallmark of the holiday season. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.todocanada.ca\/places-see-magical-christmas-lights-ontario\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light festivals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are taking place across the country this year, and since they\u2019re typically outdoors, they\u2019re a safer holiday activity. Many events have a drive-through option, so you can admire displays from the safety of your vehicle. If you\u2019re looking to get some exercise, explore the lights closer to home. Take a tour of your neighbourhood handiwork on foot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Make time for yourself<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season, changes to traditions might leave you feeling a little blue. It\u2019s normal to feel sad in difficult moments. Taking care of yourself as personal needs arise is a smart way to avoid burning out. Being there for others is important, but so is taking time to unwind. Whether it\u2019s time alone with a good book, a supportive friend, or your therapist, don\u2019t forget to make time for yourself during the busy weeks ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From virtual gatherings to hand-written letters, there are lots of ways to have fun together while staying apart this year. With a little creativity, you and your loved ones can have a great time this holiday season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not feeling like yourself, speak to one of our therapists. You can book an appointment from the comfort of home from your phone, tablet or computer.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holidays are a time we usually get together with loved ones.
