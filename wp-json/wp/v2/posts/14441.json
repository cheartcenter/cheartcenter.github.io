For some babies it\u2019s painless and they show very few signs that they\u2019re teething, while others can hit every symptom on the list. Whatever your experience, it can be hard to distinguish between fact and fiction when it comes to teething. We\u2019re helping you sift through the misinformation to welcome baby\u2019s first teeth gracefully.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When do babies get teeth?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for teeth order are helpful for showing which teeth should come in when. But parents shouldn\u2019t be concerned if their child\u2019s teeth come in out of order \u2014 your baby hasn\u2019t read the medical text. Typically the bottom two come in first, followed by the top two and then they sort of fan out from there (check out this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/topics\/oral-health\/caring-your-teeth-mouth\/children.html#a5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a handy visual).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies are unpredictable. Until that first tooth comes through the gums, you can\u2019t always tell if your child\u2019s behaviour is due to teething. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you know when a baby is teething?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Age is usually a good indicator. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teething age<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is between six to ten months (though some kids cut teeth early, and others late). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baby teeth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">come in late<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren&#8217;t usually a cause for concern, unless your child still hasn\u2019t cut their first teeth by 18 months. If this happens you should speak to a pediatric dentist, as rarely, this might be a sign of a congenital condition, anemia or cysts in the gums.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of baby\u2019s first teeth<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve likely heard that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when babies do start teething<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they get a fever. In reality, this tends to be more like a spike in temperature than a real fever. Fever is more likely to be a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teething symptom in 1-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to 2-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">year-olds<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as some get <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teething fevers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">molars<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> come through. The most common teething symptoms include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drooling<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chewing \/ biting everything<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulling on their ears<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interrupted sleep<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crying in their sleep<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced appetite<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irritability \/ increased crying<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased clinginess<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loose stool \/ diarrhea<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Alternative teething remedies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of homeopathic and \u201calternative\u201d teething products on the market <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for babies,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teething syrup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to amber necklaces. But parents should know that there is no evidence backing these products\u2019 claims to stop teething pain. And worse, some are downright dangerous. The Canadian Pediatric Association cautions that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/keep_your_young_child_safe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amber necklaces<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are both a choking hazard and a strangulation risk, for example. And many homeopathic teething formulations contain sugar or alcohol, both of which are definite no-nos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numbing agents for rubbing on baby\u2019s gums like Orajel and camphor are also out. In some children, products containing benzocaine cause dangerous side-effects like decreased oxygen levels in the blood and seizures. Orajel for babies was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/teething-gel-infant-1.5435608\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">removed from Canadian shelves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019, so if you have any in the house from older children it should be disposed of immediately. Even if it worked for your older children, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe for your new baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat teething pain<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think your baby is in pain, you can give them an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) as long as they are at least three months old. Check the back of the bottle or the paper insert to see <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how often you can give a baby Tylenol<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or Advil <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for teething<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And make sure to dose by weight instead of age, as a few pounds can make a big difference. Many think it\u2019s harmless, but Tylenol is actually <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK548162\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toxic for the liver<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in larger quantities. So while it can be tempting to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">give<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby Tylenol for teething every night<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that\u2019s not a good idea. If you\u2019re considering that, please speak with your doctor first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you can\u2019t use homeopathic products and you have to go easy on the pain medication, how are you supposed to ease baby\u2019s teething discomfort? Well, rubber and silicone teethers and soothers are a good alternative. They give your child something to bite down on which helps them to soothe themselves. But there&#8217;s no need to rush out and buy a bunch of teethers just yet \u2014 freezing a damp washcloth in a sandwich bag for half an hour works just as well. Rubbing your child\u2019s gums with a clean finger for a few minutes can also help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be dreading your baby\u2019s first teeth, or maybe you\u2019re looking forward to the day when they can munch away with the rest of the family. Maybe your baby loses two nights of sleep for every tooth they cut, or maybe you don\u2019t even notice they\u2019re teething until their first little gnasher comes through. In either case, as with all things baby-related, everything will be completely different in a few weeks. And if you\u2019re concerned that your baby\u2019s teeth aren\u2019t coming in normally, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/pediatrics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a pediatrician<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baby&#8217;s first teeth should usually arrive in a predictable pattern.
