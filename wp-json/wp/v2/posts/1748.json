I was convinced that if I saw a therapist, I\u2019d only waste their time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see, a person with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Depression-treatment\">depression<\/a> wasn\u2019t like me. At least that\u2019s what I believed. I functioned like a \u2018normal\u2019 individual. I woke up in the mornings, took showers, and went about my day just like everyone else. I appeared fine, and that was the hardest part about seeking help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did I ignore the signs that signaled I wasn\u2019t okay, everyone around me believed I was more than okay. In fact, they believed I was living my best life!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I wanted the most during my darkest times was to simply express how I felt to someone; someone who wouldn\u2019t judge me for feeling the way I felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>My days in a mental battle<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the day, I went about my mundane daily routine that temporarily blocked my thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was able to function \u2018normally\u2019 except everything around me seemed dull, and I felt lifeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At night, I battled with my internal self before falling to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some nights were better than others, but most would leave me bawling my eyes out because of my thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou\u2019re ugly.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNo one will ever want to be your friend.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou\u2019re a failure.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mental battle went on like this day after day, and month after month. Too afraid to seek help because well, \u2018I was fine.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Seeking help<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back to that difficult time, perhaps if I wasn\u2019t so reluctant to speak to a therapist, and if care had been as accessible as it is today, maybe I would have gotten help sooner. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have the right to immediately be heard and to get better, no matter your situation.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have the right to see a therapist and get better, no matter your situation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1750,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[32],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v16.4 (Yoast SEO v16.4) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>My problem was too small to see a therapist | Maple<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"You have the right to see a therapist and get better, no matter your situation.
