Unless she felt deathly sick, clinic visits just weren\u2019t worth the hassle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI work long hours, and travel is a big part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cI hardly ever find time to even go to a dentist or a doctor, because you need to sacrifice almost an entire day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Yona\u2019s ideal clinic visit<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yona was to have a perfect medical experience, it would go something like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call her local clinic;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get an appointment almost immediately;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drive to the clinic;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be seen within minutes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality didn\u2019t quite\u00a0work like that. She\u2019d wait days for an appointment, and often she\u2019d waste hours sitting in a waiting room. Eventually, she got burned out on going to the doctor, and stopped going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It didn\u2019t help that the doctor always seemed rushed, and unable to answer her questions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt some point, the doctor pretty much\u00a0told me: \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to talk about this, then you need to come again for another appointment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Or,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can Google this, and you can Google that<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yona replied by saying: &#8220;I\u2019ve already been doing. How are you helping me here?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another time, Yona discovered her doctor had relocated when she tried to visit for a badly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Sprains-Minor-Injuries-treatment\/\">twisted ankle<\/a>. When she eventually got through to her local practice, she was greeted with a voicemail promising a callback within 48 hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they eventually called her back, they didn\u2019t have any available appointment slots for a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why Yona believes in telemedicine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For obvious reasons, Yona now chooses to skip clinic visits all together: &#8220;<\/span>One of my biggest pet peeves is investing time and effort and then showing up, and the doctor saying, &#8216;just give it time and it\u2019ll get better.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yona also really doesn\u2019t like the uncertainty around waiting times. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to wait an hour, let me know that I\u2019m going to wait an hour, or book me in an hour later,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telemedicine for Yona has been hugely beneficial; a less intimidating, more convenient, and productive alternative to an in-person clinic visit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She likes the ability to receive front-end professional medical advice when she needs it that works with her busy schedule. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJust logging in, even if I have to wait, it\u2019s okay when you\u2019re in front of the computer, you can do other stuff, as opposed to going in and\u00a0waiting in-person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can do anything online, I\u2019m more than happy to do it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re like Yona, a busy professional with unfortunate clinic experiences, there\u2019s an alternative readily available at your fingertips!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re like Yona, a busy professional with unfortunate clinic experiences, there\u2019s an alternative readily
