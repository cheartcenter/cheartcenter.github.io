But did you know that you can get yeast infections on many different parts of your body, including your mouth? When this happens, it\u2019s known as thrush. And, it\u2019s not just women who suffer: new babies are most likely to be affected. Thrush is easily treatable, but if you don\u2019t know what to look for, it can make both you and your baby miserable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is thrush and what causes it?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how clean you keep yourself, your body still ends up playing host to a huge number of microscopic organisms \u2014 including yeast. Yeast is found on most healthy people\u00a0 and doesn\u2019t normally cause any issues. But when you have an overgrowth of yeast, you end up with a yeast infection. The yeast strain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/fungal\/diseases\/candidiasis\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candida Albicans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most common cause of yeast infections, as it thrives in warm, moist environments. It can produce infections ranging from vaginal yeast infections to fungal infections in your nail beds to thrush.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What causes oral thrush in babies?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your baby can pick up thrush in a variety of ways, which can make it tricky to prevent. If you have a vaginal yeast infection when you give birth, your baby can pick it up as they exit the birth canal \u2014 which is one of the reasons thrush is most common in infants <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kidshealth.org\/en\/parents\/thrush.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since breastfeeding exposes your nipples to damp, warm conditions on a regular basis, they\u2019re susceptible to yeast infections, especially if your nipples crack or you don\u2019t use fresh breast pads regularly. And because little ones are in frequent contact with your nipples, it\u2019s easy for the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yeast infection<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to colonize your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby\u2019s mouth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candida Albicans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thrives in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies\u2019 mouths<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so well because they have weaker immune systems and their mouths are so warm and damp. Medications can also cause thrush as a by-product: antibiotics can kill off the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that normally keeps Candida in check. And steroids, such as those given for common baby illnesses like croup, can do this as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from babies, thrush also disproportionately affects the elderly, as well as AIDS and cancer patients \u2014 all groups with weakened immune systems. That\u2019s why <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk factors for thrush<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> include diabetes, being immunocompromised, or having recently taken antibiotics. Sometimes, the hormonal changes of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pregnancy <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also cause <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oral thrush<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; treatment is effective and safe, even while pregnant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is thrush contagious?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrush is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n\u2019t <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contagious<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under most circumstances \u2014 it doesn\u2019t spread through coughing, sneezing, or kissing (usually), for example. Don&#8217;t worry about keeping your infant or child home from daycare, as thrush won&#8217;t spread to healthy skin. In some cases, however, as with breastfeeding mothers and their nursing babies, thrush is contagious, as it can be transmitted back and forth between the mother\u2019s breasts and the baby\u2019s mouth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Newborn thrush vs. milk tongue<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrush is usually visible as whitish patches on your baby\u2019s tongue. This shouldn\u2019t be confused with \u201cmilk tongue,\u201d which is just the traces of milk left on the tongue. Breastfed infants drink a lot of milk and they don\u2019t produce much saliva until three months or so, so it\u2019s normal for your baby to have traces of milk in their mouth much of the time. If you\u2019re able to gently wipe this white residue away, if it appears only on the tongue, or if your baby has no other symptoms, it\u2019s likely just milk tongue. But if you can\u2019t wipe these white patches away, or if your baby is also exhibiting other symptoms of thrush, it\u2019s time to check with a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of oral thrush<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White patches that look like milk or cottage cheese on the inside of your baby\u2019s mouth or on their lips that you can&#8217;t wipe away.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cracking in the corners of your baby&#8217;s lips.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shorter feeding periods, decreased appetite, or your baby frequently pulling off your breast.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased crankiness or<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fussiness when your baby is nursing or using a pacifier.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your baby has oral thrush, there\u2019s a chance that mom also has nipple thrush. In this case you might notice that your nipples are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pink and shiny<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flaky<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itchy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might also experience stinging, or sharp, shooting pains while breastfeeding and\/or pain between nursing sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diagnosing oral thrush<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your doctor will diagnose a case of thrush based on your description of symptoms. They will likely want to look at your baby\u2019s mouth as well. Rarely, your doctor may want to take a scraping of one of the white patches to examine under a microscope.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to treat thrush in babies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrush will sometimes go away on its own after a few days. But if either you or your baby is experiencing discomfort or your baby is eating noticeably less, see your doctor. They\u2019ll likely prescribe an antifungal medication to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treat<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your child\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oral candidiasis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (another name for thrush). Until recently, gentian violet was often prescribed as an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oral thrush treatment for babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, either alone or in addition to other antifungals. However a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/healthycanadians.gc.ca\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2019\/70179a-eng.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent alert<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Health Canada warns Canadians to stop using all products containing gentian violet, as it may increase your risk of cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to tell your doctor about any other symptoms your baby may have, such as diaper rash, as your doctor will likely want to treat that differently. If both you and your child have an infection, it\u2019s imperative you both receive treatment. Otherwise you risk re-infecting one another. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need an oral anti-yeast medication for yourself, or if you can simply treat your nipples with an over-the-counter (OTC) yeast infection cream. They should also advise you on how long to wait to breastfeed after treating your nipples with that cream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treating thrush in toddlers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is no different than with a baby, though you might have more trouble giving an older child an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oral thrush medication<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why do I keep getting thrush?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeast is often able to enter the mother\u2019s nipple because of a break in the skin. This often happens with an improper latch or an undiagnosed tongue tie. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrush<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> women may continue to return because it hasn\u2019t been treated properly, or because the underlying issues that caused it haven\u2019t been addressed. If you find yourself with recurrent thrush, it\u2019s important to speak to a lactation consultant (LC) or a physician to figure out what else is going on. Share your health history with your doctor to rule out any underlying health issues (such as diabetes). This is true for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too, as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resistant or recurring oral thrush<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be a sign that their immune system is wrestling with an as-yet undiagnosed health issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure your baby has a proper latch from the beginning of your breastfeeding journey can help limit nipple cracking. As well, using the right supplies can help prevent thrush: plastic-lined nursing pads and improperly sterilized bottles and pacifiers provide a warm, moist environment for yeast to thrive in, so make sure anything touching your breasts or going into your baby\u2019s mouth is clean, dry, and in good shape. Pain during breastfeeding isn\u2019t normal \u2014 plus, accompanying changes in your baby\u2019s behaviour often signal that something is wrong. If you have any concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/lactation-specialist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lactation consultant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oral thrush can be passed back and forth between a breastfeeding mother and her baby.
