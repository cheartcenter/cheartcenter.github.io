One thing that\u2019s stayed fairly consistent though, are the terms self-isolate and self-quarantine. But what do they mean? And how do you do either if you\u2019re living in a house with other people? We\u2019re breaking down the 5 W\u2019s \u2014 plus a few extra \u201chows\u201d \u2014 to make sure you have all the facts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Who should self-isolate and who should self-quarantine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many people are using the terms \u201cself-isolate\u201d and \u201cself-quarantine\u201d interchangeably,\u00a0 there\u2019s one key difference. It comes down to whether you currently have symptoms of coronavirus. If you do have symptoms, you \u201cself-isolate.\u201d If you don\u2019t have any COVID-19 symptoms, you \u201cself-quarantine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we have the definitions out of the way, you should self-quarantine if you\u2019ve been exposed to coronavirus, either by coming in direct contact with a person who has been diagnosed, or if you&#8217;ve travelled in the last 14 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re actively presenting symptoms of COVID-19, you should self-isolate regardless of whether you can recall where you might have come into contact with coronavirus or not. If you have severe symptoms or are having difficulty breathing, call 911 immediately and be sure to tell the dispatcher that you believe you may have been exposed to coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P.S. if you\u2019re not sure whether you have the symptoms of a cold or allergies versus coronavirus, we have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/cold-flu-allergies-or-covid-19-how-to-tell-the-difference\/\">helpful guide for that here<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What are self-isolation and self-quarantine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they have two different names, self-isolation and self-quarantine are very much the same. Both mean limiting your interactions with other people to prevent potentially spreading the virus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is very tricky if you\u2019re living with other people, but here are a few basics to keep in mind:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay home. Don\u2019t use public transit, taxis or ride shares, and don\u2019t go to work, school or other public places.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t have visitors in your home and keep away from seniors and anyone with chronic health concerns such as diabetes, lung conditions, or a weakened immune system. These groups are at particular risk of becoming chronically ill from COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If possible, stay in a single room in your home. If you need to leave that room, wear a mask to limit the spread of particles if you cough.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rigorously clean all surfaces. A two-step process is best for this. First, clean surfaces with household cleaners, then use a disinfecting cleanser or wipe. This ensures that the virus can\u2019t hide from the disinfectant in everyday household dust and dirt.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of course, make sure that anyone who is in self-isolation or self-quarantine has lots of food and water to keep their immune system strong. To limit exposure, leave food outside the door and make sure each party only touches their side of the door to limit exposure.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Why should people self-isolate or self-quarantine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 is highly contagious. And while the overall mortality rate is fairly low \u2014 about 2% \u2014 it\u2019s highly dangerous to those with a weakened immune system and anyone over the age of 60.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding to this is the fact that a continuous, dry cough is one of the key markers of coronavirus. Just like with the flu, when someone with coronavirus coughs, particles of the virus can travel up to 6 feet! Viruses can also live for several hours, or in some cases days, on surfaces. This makes it easy for people who aren\u2019t infected to pick them up on their hands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means it\u2019s also important to limit the number of times you touch your face, and especially your eyes, nose and mouth. This goes for any viral outbreak, not just COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Where can someone self-isolate or self-quarantine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best place to self-isolate or self-quarantine is in a room within your home. Ideally it would have its own bathroom as well to limit the number of times you need to leave the room, though that\u2019s not always possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in self-isolation or self-quarantine and you share common areas with others in your home, ensure you minimize the time spent outside of your dedicated isolation or quarantine room and always wear a mask while in common areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those living in the common areas, wash your hands frequently, ensuring you pay close attention to the pads of your fingers and in between your fingers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also best to clean the surfaces in your home frequently. Again, a two-step process is best for this. First, clean surfaces with household cleaners, then use a disinfecting cleaner. This ensures that the virus can\u2019t hide from the disinfectant in everyday household dust and dirt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>When can someone stop self-isolation or self-quarantine?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in self-isolation, you should confirm with a public health or a healthcare provider to determine when you can safely end your self-isolation. This is due to conflicting reports on how long the virus can last in your body after you stop experiencing symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should stay in self-quarantine for at least 14 days from the time you were potentially exposed to COVID-19. If you still don\u2019t have any symptoms after 14 days, evidence to date (March 20) suggests you can safely end your self-quarantine. This is because it\u2019s believed that it can take up to 14 days for COVID-19 symptoms to appear.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>When should you speak with a doctor?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having trouble breathing or experiencing other severe symptoms, you should call 911. Be sure to tell the dispatcher that you may have COVID-19 to ensure that paramedics arrive at your home with the proper gear to protect everyone involved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not experiencing emergency symptoms, you should talk to a doctor before self-diagnosing. Symptoms may appear differently in different people. Rather than heading straight to the doctor\u2019s office or ER, contact your local health unit to find out the best course of action for being screened for coronavirus. Ontario residents with a valid OHIP number can also be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\">screened for COVID-19<\/a> through Maple in a matter of hours without leaving home. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/msp-and-virtual-healthcare\/\">Those in BC<\/a> can also have online doctor visits covered under the provinces Medical Services Plan (MSP).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a non-urgent medical need such as a prescription refill, or questions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/coronavirus-everything-you-need-to-know\/\">about COVID-19<\/a>, our doctors are available online 24\/7, 365 days a year from wherever you are to help address your needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems like we\u2019re hearing new COVID-19 advice every day.
