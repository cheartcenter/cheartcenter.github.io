We\u2019ll also talk about how speech disorders can affect your ability to speak, some common causes, and frequently used treatments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a speech disorder?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most people may recognize a few different types of speech disorders, there\u2019s actually a wide range of conditions relating to speech disorders. Some may be present at birth, or develop over a long period of time. There are some speech disorders caused by issues relating to neurological function, and others that are the result of disabilities or injuries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speech disorders are conditions that affect a person\u2019s ability to make the sounds necessary to form words. These can also affect the fluency of their words or the quality of their voice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not to be confused with language disorders. Language disorders impair a person\u2019s ability to learn new words or understand what is being said to them, or their use of spoken, written, or symbol systems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speech disorders can prevent you from communicating clearly with other people, or make it difficult to articulate yourself when you\u2019re trying to speak.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are some common speech disorders?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a wide range of conditions that fall into the category of speech disorders, but the three most commonly occurring speech disorders are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stuttering<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apraxia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dysarthria<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This discussion will focus on these most frequently occurring types of speech disorders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some other types of speech disorders include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orofacial myofunctional disorders (relating to abnormal growth or development of the facial bones and muscles, such as cleft lip, palate, or tongue-tie)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Articulation disorders (relating to the inability to form specific sounds, causing verbal distortion when speaking)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluency disorders (developmental stuttering or neurologic stuttering)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voice disorders (misuse or organic changes of the vocal mechanism such as vocal polyps, nodules, or webbing to name a few)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autism-related speech disorders (relating to possible language disorders, as well)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resonance disorders (relating to blockages in the mouth, nose, and throat, which causes changes to voice quality)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What can cause a speech disorder?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two different types of stuttering speech disorders, each with their own causes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neurogenic stuttering refers to stuttering caused by an issue preventing proper coordination between the different parts of the brain that allow for speech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developmental stuttering typically affects young children who are still learning to speak. The risks of this occurring in children could be increased dramatically, depending on the child\u2019s genetics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apraxia is caused by damage to the parts of the brain that allow the brain to communicate with different parts of the body. Verbal apraxia refers to an issue with the motor skills that allow a person to speak or correctly form the sounds of words &#8211; even if they know what they want to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dysarthria on the other hand is a condition affecting the tone, strength, and coordination of all or any of the muscles used for speaking. This weakness may make speech very difficult for the person affected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some direct causes of the brain damage or muscle weakness relating to speech disorders include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vocal cord damage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strokes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nodules or polyps on the vocal cords<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vocal cord paralysis<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respiratory weakness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head injury<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dementia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Degenerative diseases (i.e., Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington\u2019s disease)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autism<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down syndrome<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing loss<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are some signs and symptoms of a speech disorder?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most commonly seen signs and symptoms of speech disorders include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repetition<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elongating words or sounds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jerky movements while speaking (usually involving the head)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frustration when trying to speak<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blinking repeatedly while talking<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding extra sounds or words when speaking<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rearranging syllables<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty with pronunciation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking very quietly<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking in a raspy, gravelly, or hoarse voice<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distorting sounds when speaking<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequent pauses between words<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking very slowly<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How are speech disorders diagnosed?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you believe that you or your child could have a speech disorder, there are numerous steps involved in a speech disorder diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The physician will first discuss your medical and academic histories, arrange emotional and intelligence evaluations and evaluate your interactions with them during the examination. They will also suggest hearing and vision testing be performed, before suggesting any specific speech disorder tests be conducted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some frequently suggested speech disorder tests include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Denver articulation screening exam<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic evaluation of motor speech skills manual (DEMSS)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prosody-voice screen profile<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early language milestones scale 2<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peabody picture vocabulary test<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tests will help determine if you have a speech disorder, but they won\u2019t necessarily determine the exact causes of your speech disorder. Additional testing may be required to determine the underlying cause of your speech disorder, so that appropriate treatments can be recommended.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How are speech disorders treated?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of speech therapy treatments that are recommended for you will normally depend on the severity of your condition, as well as what the doctor has determined the underlying cause of your condition might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common type of speech therapy treatment is speech therapy, which focuses on exercises to build familiarity with using certain sounds or words. This could also involve physical exercises designed to strengthen muscles that allow us to produce sounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, there are other treatments that could be suggested, depending on your condition. Some of these include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrast therapy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target selection therapy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oral-motor therapy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contextual utilization therapy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ear devices (to replay an altered version of the wearer\u2019s voice, or provide a sound that helps control stuttering)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medications (to treat anxiety brought on by speech disorders, which could worsen symptoms)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some speech disorders may go away on their own or lessen with time.
