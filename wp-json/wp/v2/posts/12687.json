She lives in a dormitory and has a full class schedule. But, she\u2019s struggling to keep up. If she\u2019s running late to a lecture she\u2019ll just skip it all together because she doesn\u2019t want everyone\u2019s eyes on her as she walks in. Megan doesn\u2019t want to book an appointment with a guidance counselor because she can already imagine herself choking on her words and making a fool of herself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to a social life, Megan feels deficient. She doesn\u2019t have many friends on campus. When she does go to social events, she tends not to say anything because she\u2019s afraid of how her voice will sound, and whether everyone will judge her as a loser. The one friend she has, Rosie, lives on her floor in the dorm. Megan suspects Rosie only befriended her out of sympathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is social anxiety?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan is just one of millions of people who struggle with social anxiety. Social anxiety, also known as social phobia, is the fear of being judged by other people. This condition can become disruptive to your life if left untreated. People with social anxiety often feel nervous around:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being introduced to other people.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Receiving negative feedback.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the centre of attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being watched while doing something.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public speaking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting people in authority positions, such as a boss or teacher.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making eye contact.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The paradox around social anxiety is that people with this condition really do want to make friends and participate in social situations. When they\u2019re out in public, however, negative thoughts and physical symptoms can take over.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socially anxious people might feel like they stick out due to their awkwardness, but the truth is they\u2019re far from alone. Social anxiety is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adaa.org\/understanding-anxiety\/social-anxiety-disorder\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, after specific phobia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you suspect you have social anxiety, it\u2019s important to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get help<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Speaking with a therapist can greatly improve your comfort levels in social situations, as well as your self-esteem.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Signs you suffer from social anxiety<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with social anxiety often display physical symptoms when they\u2019re in social situations, or are thinking about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning red in the face.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Racing heartbeat.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trembling of the limbs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweating.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upset stomach or nausea.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty breathing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dizziness or lightheadedness.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muscle tension.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty speaking, or speaking quietly.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, mental and emotional symptoms are even more intrusive than physical symptoms. Emotional distress can cause people to stay home, avoid their friends, and can lead to poor performance at school or work. This can turn into a self-feeding cycle as the person with anxiety becomes convinced that the longer they stay isolated, the fewer social connections they have to come back to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Social anxiety triggers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with social anxiety often feel fear around:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Situations where they might be judged.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarrassing themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interacting with strangers.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fear that others will notice they look anxious.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as hyperventilating.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expecting the worst possible outcome from a situation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common tendency with social anxiety is to overanalyze situations from your past where you felt embarrassed. A familiar scenario is when you lie awake at night, cringing over something you said as a small child. Likely everyone else has forgotten about it, but your mind can\u2019t help but fixate on that event.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with social anxiety will commonly avoid social situations such as dating, parties, returning items to a store, using a public restroom, and even school or work. If your anxiety is causing you to opt out of life situations, that\u2019s a strong indicator to seek help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to overcome social anxiety<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/ptsd-guideline\/patients-and-families\/cognitive-behavioral\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the top recommended treatment for social anxiety. In CBT, you and a psychotherapist will work on identifying unhelpful thought patterns and learned social behaviours. Then, you\u2019ll come up with coping skills to help you be more effective and content in your life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a few sessions with a psychotherapist can make a profound difference. If you don\u2019t want to see a therapist in person, you can always try <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online therapy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Online therapy has been found to be just as effective as traditional therapy, and is a good first step in breaking out of your comfort zone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to therapy, try these methods for controlling your anxiety symptoms the next time you feel stressed or panicked:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Control your breathing. Take a long, deep breath through your nose and feel the air expand your lungs. Hold your breath for a count of three, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try progressive muscle relaxation. It\u2019s helpful to use an audio guide. Meditation apps and Youtube videos are a great place to start.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the focus off yourself. If you feel yourself becoming anxious, try focusing on something else in the room. Notice it\u2019s size, shape, and colours.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk back to negative thoughts. This is especially helpful if you\u2019ve already done some therapy, and can take a more objective look at your anxiety \u201cvoice.\u201d If you\u2019re worrying \u201cIf I speak up, people will think I\u2019m annoying,\u201d try countering it with the thought \u201cI have as much a right to speak up as anyone. I have good ideas, and people want to hear them.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore your senses. Focusing on what you see, hear, feel, smell, and taste can help take you out of your mind and bring you into the present moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to get help for social anxiety<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to get help for social anxiety. If left untreated it can seriously impact your self-esteem, cause low academic or career achievement, prevent you from developing social connections, and lead to substance abuse and suicidality. You don\u2019t have to deal with social anxiety alone. A therapist can help you dismantle negative thoughts, and lead a more fulfilling life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for a therapist but can\u2019t find one that fits your needs or schedule, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online therapy might be the answer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
