Maybe you have a scar from it, or remember wearing oven mitts to stop you from scratching. Many Canadian millennials, however, have never had chickenpox, because in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2094900\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2000<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health Canada started a chickenpox vaccination campaign. Vaccines protect us from some of the most harmful diseases out there \u2014 including chickenpox (and later shingles). You only have to look at countries without well-established vaccination programs to see the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">importance of vaccination<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s, and the number of deaths they prevent. But there are some minimal risks associated with getting vaccinated. We\u2019re looking at the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits and side effects<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to help you make the best decision about vaccinating your baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Types of vaccinations<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind vaccines is to introduce safe substances into your body that mimic the appearance of a virus or bacteria. This enables your immune system to recognize them later on in life and react appropriately (and aggressively) to the disease. There are a few different types of vaccines. Some, called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vaccines.gov\/basics\/types\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recombinant vaccines and toxoid vaccines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, use only specific parts of a virus, germ, or their by-products to protect you from the disease. But Canadian children are more likely to get either an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vaccine-safety-training.org\/live-attenuated-vaccines.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attenuated live vaccine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or an inactivated vaccine (more on these below), which can be delivered either orally or by injection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An attenuated live vaccine contains a weakened version of a disease. This means that the pathogen that causes the disease is \u201calive\u201d when it\u2019s injected into you, but not in a form where it\u2019s able to give you the disease. Your body still sees the pathogen as a threat, however, which prompts your immune system into developing antibodies against any future infections from the disease. This type of vaccine is highly effective and usually gives you lifetime protection against the disease. An example of an attenuated live vaccine is the MMR vaccine which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inactivated vaccines contain a dead version of a disease or pathogen. Your immune system recognizes the dead virus as a threat and responds, but without the risk of developing the disease. The drawback with inactivated vaccines is that they are less effective than attenuated live vaccines and usually require multiple booster shots to provide full immunity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby vaccinations in Canada<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccination schedules vary slightly across the country, but most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> go <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first vaccine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the two-month mark. This<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0first vaccine<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a combined shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and haemophilus influenzae (type B). They\u2019ll also receive two additional vaccines at this appointment, one for pneumonia and one for rotavirus. They&#8217;ll take the rotavirus vaccine orally, the other two as shots. So even though they\u2019ll get three vaccines, your little one will \u201conly\u201d have two needles at their first vaccination appointment. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tip to make the process easier? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD011248\/SYMPT_does-breastfeeding-reduce-vaccination-pain-babies-aged-1-12-months\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breastfeeding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the injection helps them deal with the pain. If you\u2019re not breastfeeding, giving your baby a tiny bit of sugar water can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this first set of vaccinations, the typical schedule is at four months, six months, 12 months, 15 months, and 18 months. Except for the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/see-a-doctor-online-for-flu-treatment-skip-the-germy-waiting-room\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shot, which both you and your child should get annually (once they\u2019re over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/immunizebc.ca\/influenza\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six months<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Your little one will get a break from needles from 18 months until they turn four. For exact timing, check out Health Canada\u2019s province or territory-specific <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthycanadians.gc.ca\/apps\/vaccination-schedule\/index-eng.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vaccination schedule<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms after baby vaccinations<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occasionally, some babies have mild reactions to vaccines. Soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site are the most common side effects. Some kids also get a low-grade fever. Any of these side effects will likely make your child cranky or upset. Feel free to cuddle and breast or bottle feed your child as usual to comfort them. Giving them the appropriate dose of infant Advil or Tylenol will also bring their fever down, and ease any soreness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Serious side effects of vaccines<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although new parents often worry about them, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">serious side effects of vaccines<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are extremely rare. Anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction, happens somewhere in the range of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/immunizebc.ca\/side-effects\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in 100,000 to one in a million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The good news is that it is quite treatable and it usually happens almost immediately. This is why your healthcare provider will ask you to hang around for 15 minutes after baby gets their shots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In extremely rare cases (about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/flu-vaccine-safety-effectiveness\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in one million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), vaccinations might trigger <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw65904\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (GBS). This is an autoimmune condition that can cause muscle weakness, numbness, and even paralysis. But it usually goes away after 4 weeks. While it might seem that no vaccine is worth risking paralysis (however temporary), the risk of getting GBS from a disease is higher than the risk of getting it from the vaccination for that disease. So your baby will be safer from GBS with a vaccine than without.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to avoid vaccination<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While vaccinations can be nerve wracking, there\u2019s usually no reason <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to avoid vaccinating<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The baby vaccination schedule in Canada was developed specifically with the best interests of children in mind. It takes into account when their immune systems can handle vaccinations, and at what age they\u2019re most at risk of contracting certain diseases. Even if your baby is allergic to some of the common ingredients in vaccines, your doctor will often be able to recommend an alternative. That being said, there are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/vpd\/should-not-vacc.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reasons<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> some children shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated. These include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having developed GBS immediately following a previous vaccination<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child is immunocompromised (speak to your doctor for more specifics)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your child currently has a very high fever (this isn\u2019t dangerous, but if the child has a reaction to the vaccine it can be hard to tell. Once their fever subsides it\u2019s safe to vaccinate them).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Is vaccination mandatory in Canada?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines are highly effective, and protect us from diseases that cause a number of serious complications, including death. But even though it\u2019s safe, immunization isn\u2019t mandatory in Canada. While children in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/immunize.ca\/immunization-mandatory-canada\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ontario and New Brunswick<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have to provide proof of immunization in order to register for school, they can opt out for medical or ideological reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Vaccinations and \u201cherd immunity\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some parents wrongly assume they don\u2019t have to vaccinate their children because of \u201cherd immunity.\u201d While living in an area where most people are immunized against <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/measles\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">measles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, does offer some protection for example, if you\u2019re exposed to the virus and aren\u2019t vaccinated, chances are high that you&#8217;ll get it. And for a disease like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/tetanus\/about\/causes-transmission.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tetanus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where the pathogen isn\u2019t transmitted from person to person but from soil, herd immunity doesn\u2019t apply. If your child hasn\u2019t been vaccinated and they&#8217;re exposed, they\u2019re at risk of developing tetanus, which is frequently fatal. Herd immunity as a concept can reduce the transmission of particular diseases in some cases. But it doesn\u2019t protect individuals if they are exposed to those viruses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the idea of giving your precious little monkey a needle probably isn\u2019t your favourite, there\u2019s good reason to do it: mass vaccination programs have saved <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/publications\/10-year-review\/vaccines\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">millions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of lives, and that\u2019s just in the last decade. Vaccines help your immune system work better \u2014 essentially they teach your body how to protect itself from deadly diseases. While some people aren\u2019t able to get them in rare cases, vaccines are overwhelmingly the right choice when it comes to protecting your child.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baby vaccinations in Canada are designed to happen at the most appropriate time in a child&#8217;s life.
