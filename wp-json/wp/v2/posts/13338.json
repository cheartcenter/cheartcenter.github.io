Disciples of the practice claim that its benefits are seemingly endless \u2014 from lowering stress to making you a better person. But to the casual participant, meditation can feel weird and even increase the irritability and frustration it\u2019s supposed to help control. We\u2019re looking at some of the claims surrounding meditation to find out if it actually works.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is meditation?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us sort of know what meditation is. But, between the claims that it involves transcending our bodies to reach nirvana or that we can use it to stave off ageing, its exact definition can get lost. The basic idea is that meditation helps you focus your attention inward so you can calm yourself and quiet your mind. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s a practice \u2014 you\u2019re not supposed to do it just once. A meditation practice is like exercise for your mind. It helps you strengthen the mental muscles that allow you to achieve peace and calm. Eventually, those muscles become so strong that you can enter a peaceful and focused state whenever you need to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do you meditate?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of different kinds of meditations, so if you\u2019ve tried meditating before and hated it, it might be worth giving another kind of practice a shot. A popular one involves eating chocolate and paying attention to the sensations that elicits. Others can involve a guided audio narrative, exercising or reciting certain mantras \u2014 the list goes on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What do you use meditation for?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some meditation advocates claim that its uses are pretty much infinite. But while some studies are promising, other research is scanty and downright problematic. Certain claims, however, are scientifically backed. It looks like meditation can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3156028\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase happiness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3303565\/#:~:text=Meditation%20techniques%20appear%20to%20produce,systolic%20and%20diastolic%20blood%20pressure.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decrease blood pressure<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, increase alertness and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6088366\/#:~:text=Past%20research%20has%20found%20that,Attention%20Network%20Test%20(ANT).\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">focus attention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.psych.uncc.edu\/pagoolka\/seminar\/jofpain2009.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce pain<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. How it compares to other interventions for these issues, like medication, isn\u2019t always clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other claims, however, are completely bogus. F<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or example, meditation does nothing to help <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancerresearchuk.org\/about-cancer\/cancer-in-general\/treatment\/complementary-alternative-therapies\/individual-therapies\/meditation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treat or prevent cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite what certain internet activists say. It also doesn\u2019t make you a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2018\/02\/05\/meditation-does-not-make-better-person-study-finds\/#:~:text=Meditation%20does%20not%20make,more%20compassionate%20towards%20other%20people.&amp;text=%22We%20did%20not%20find%20that,compared%20to%20a%20placebo%20effect.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">better person<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A third category of claims about the benefits of meditation seem promising, but doesn\u2019t yet have large-scale research results. Meditation may help to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4024457\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stave off cognitive decline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even if this claim is true, meditation should only be used as one of many tools to fight dementia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the side-effects of meditation?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem like meditation is risk-free, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0176239\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and anecdotes have exposed negative side-effects. Some individuals report experiencing racing thoughts, anxiety, paranoia, depression and panic. Sitting with yourself and \u201cwatching\u201d the thoughts that come up without judgment can actually be quite difficult. For individuals who have survived trauma, or who are struggling with mental illness, meditation can be quite intense. In certain individuals it doesn\u2019t always provide the benefits it claims, and it might actually do harm by providing a space for things to surface that are difficult to process without additional support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individuals dealing with chronic stress or suffering from depression, meditation alone may not be enough. These people might feel like something is wrong with them if meditation isn\u2019t bringing about profound improvements in their work performance, marriage, sleep, and so on. If you\u2019re looking for a quick way to destress but are concerned that meditation might be too intense for you, progressive muscle relaxation and simple breathing exercises are good alternatives. For those grappling with heavier issues, however, additional <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mental health support<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If meditation is your cup of tea then go for it \u2014 there\u2019s a meditation out there for every day of the year. Meditation can be a powerful mental practice. But there are a lot of other ways to calm yourself and focus your awareness if it\u2019s not for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The merits of meditation are popularly known.
