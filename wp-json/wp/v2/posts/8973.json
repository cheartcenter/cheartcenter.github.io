Especially when you\u2019re just starting out \u2014 sleep deprived and overwhelmed. From worrying about your milk supply to wondering why your newborn baby is not eating often enough, breastfeeding can end up adding a whole new level of stress to parenting. We interviewed veteran lactation consultant (LC) Fara Patterson to help us figure out when to relax and when we should be concerned.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I tell if baby is getting enough milk?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike with bottle feeding, it\u2019s hard to tell how much milk a breastfed infant is drinking. Short of rigging up a baby scale to weigh them before and after a feed, there\u2019s no real way to know what they\u2019re taking in. But according to Patterson, there are other ways of figuring it out. \u201cAfter your milk comes in, you should see milk at your baby\u2019s mouth. You should see slow, deep gulping. And most importantly, your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s pee and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poop frequency<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will tell you.\u201d Most women receive a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/990e-tph-bf-breastfeedingyournaby-booklet-eng-2016.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when they leave the hospital that lets them know the number of diapers a newborn baby should produce on a daily basis. If you\u2019re hitting that target, your baby is getting enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I tell if I have low supply?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterson gets this question a lot. \u201cMothers get concerned around cluster feeding in those early days. They start to think they don\u2019t have enough milk because baby\u2019s always there feeding, and that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d she says. Knowing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how many diapers per day<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is normal <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newborn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is key, but your baby\u2019s demeanour is also an indication. \u201cIs your baby comfortable and settled after a feed or are they waking up constantly and screaming? Is baby feeding for over an hour at a time but never seems content and full? Are they droopy and listless? If you\u2019re seeing dark yellow pee and their poop colour doesn\u2019t change, your newborn baby is not eating enough. Seeing your doctor within 72 hours is also crucial, because we put a lot of stock in what your baby\u2019s weight is doing.\u201d If none of these factors apply, and your baby is gaining weight, then they\u2019re probably doing great.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What do I do if I have low supply?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ibconline.ca\/information-sheets\/domperidone\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domperidone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gets a lot of publicity as a \u201cwonder drug\u201d capable of fixing all your breastfeeding woes. But before you run to your doctor for a prescription, there are other options to try first says Patterson. \u201cFor <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> caused by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">low milk supply<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re probably going to start pumping. As your baby grows, it goes through growth spurts and starts going to your breasts really frequently. This forces your body to kick up milk production. Pumping after nursing is just like telling your body that there\u2019s a growth spurt happening with that baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs well, we\u2019re going to look at your latch. If your baby isn\u2019t latched deeply and positioned well, they won\u2019t have a latch that can efficiently strip milk out of your breast and help your body understand that it has to refill. And if you only have a baby snacking on a small fraction of what\u2019s available, then the body\u2019s response to that is only to refill that small fraction.\u201d Basically, breastmilk is produced on a supply-and-demand basis. The body replaces only what is removed. So you\u2019ll want to figure out how to increase the demand in order to increase the supply.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>I think my milk is taking too long to come in<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before your baby is born, your breasts begin producing colostrum. When your milk comes in, three to five days after birth, it\u2019s called lactogenesis II. While that can seem like a long time to go without milk, Patterson reassures her clients that \u201cfull-term babies come packing a lunch, which means that they have extra fat on them. Between that fat and colostrum, they\u2019re getting by.\u201d She does caution, however, that babies who are born early or small do sometimes need intervention. And all babies must be seen by a doctor or midwife within the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/indigenous-services-canada\/services\/first-nations-inuit-health\/health-care-services\/nursing\/clinical-practice-guidelines-nurses-primary-care\/pediatric-adolescent-care\/chapter-1-pediatric-health-assessment.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first 72 hours of their birth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a weigh-in, a well-baby check, and medical guidance. If you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s health before their first checkup, however, don\u2019t wait. Concerns regarding a newborn are a priority and you should have no trouble getting a same day appointment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>My baby is feeding \u201ctoo much\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patterson draws a distinction between the first few days of cluster feeding and prolonged back-to-back short feeds later on, which might signal that something is wrong. \u201cUntil about day three to five when baby is getting by on colostrum, they\u2019re going to be at your breast stimulating. Mother nature wants them doing that to get you to make milk. It\u2019s part of the process. It\u2019s not easy and nobody likes it very much, but it\u2019s natural. But if cluster feeding is still constant at day eight, you should speak with an LC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCluster feeding also happens in and around growth spurts \u2014 it can come back. But then it\u2019s a different creature, it\u2019s not about getting your milk in anymore. Some babies are fussy at the end of the day and want to do back-to-back feedings to settle themselves. But if you\u2019re coming to me at week two and saying your baby has never stopped cluster feeding, that\u2019s probably an indicator that you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d It\u2019s normal for the amount your baby eats to fluctuate over time. But big changes might be a signal that all is not right. When in doubt, trust your gut!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>My newborn baby is not eating enough<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn the early days, you need to make sure you\u2019re getting in eight to 10 feeds in 24 hours no matter what,\u201d Patterson stresses. Even, she says, if that means waking baby up to nurse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reading baby\u2019s hunger cues can sometimes be confusing, especially at first or if they were born prematurely. In these cases Patterson suggests reaching out for some support. \u201cSometimes early babies don\u2019t cue you like a full-term baby does. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a good idea to speak to an LC \u2013 they\u2019ll teach you about what a 36 or 37 weeker is doing.\u201d But if you suspect your newborn baby is not getting enough to eat, your first appointment needs to be with your physician, who may suggest that you supplement with formula, at least for a bit. Once your child has been assessed by a doctor, however, seeing an LC is a great second step. Especially because baby not eating enough can cause engorgement (if there isn\u2019t a supply issue).\u00a0 This can make your breasts quite hard, which can cause the baby to have <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problems latching on<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and ultimately make the situation worse. If this happens, hand expel some milk before nursing until your breasts are somewhat less hard. Left unaddressed, engorgement can lead to blocked ducts and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/mastitis-dont-let-it-ruin-your-breastfeeding-journey\/\">mastitis<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are millions of things for new parents to worry about. When breastfeeding doesn\u2019t come easily, wondering if your baby is getting what they need gets added to the list. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfeeding problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are overwhelming for new parents, lactation consultants have years of experience to draw on and speaking with one can be hugely beneficial. From pain to latching and supply issues, they\u2019ve seen it all. If you have concerns, speaking to one can help put your mind at ease.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breastfeeding is tough and comes with many questions.
