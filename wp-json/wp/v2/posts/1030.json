This makes it easy to put off seeing a doctor for the little things you&#8217;re used to just ignoring. The itchy eyes that you think might be from your allergies. What are you allergic to\u00a0anyway? You&#8217;ve never been sure. There\u2019s a rash on your side that doesn&#8217;t ever quite\u00a0clear up. Is it eczema? Psoriasis? Or just something you ate? Maybe you have a mole you&#8217;re not sure about, or really bad headaches &#8211; just once in a while though. Nothing to worry about&#8230;right? You&#8217;re so used to living with these things, they hardly bother you (or so you tell yourself). Do you really need to get it checked out? We say yes &#8211; it&#8217;s important to take care of yourself!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Self-care basics to feel your best<\/h2>\n<p>Self-care or wellness is super popular right now &#8211; just check out your social media accounts. Long baths, sleeping in, good eats&#8230;can anyone argue with that? You shouldn\u2019t need an excuse, but people often feel guilty taking time out for themselves. Frame it as a necessary activity for good health, and some of that guilt goes away. A $15 raw juice, anyone? But before you blow your next paycheque on a healing crystal, think about going back to the basics when it comes to your health. Exercise, fresh foods, proper sleep &#8211; and making time to see your doctor.<\/p>\n<p>Primary care plays a major role in maintaining your overall health and well-being. &#8220;Not only is it effective for diagnosing and treating illnesses and injuries, it&#8217;s probably the most important thing for keeping you healthy in the first place,&#8221; says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\">Dr. Peter Iracelous<\/a>, Toronto ER and Maple physician.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<blockquote><p>Many chronic illnesses, like diabetes, initially come with no symptoms, and you can feel perfectly great, all the way until you\u2019ve already done irreversible damage to your body.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Your family doctor is the first line of defense, and a key player in helping you live your best, healthiest life. Ideally, they&#8217;re very familiar with you and your medical history. You might remember the process of getting a yearly physical, where your family doctor checks on your height, weight, blood pressure and vision. They often order a battery of tests as well to make sure you&#8217;re in good working order. If it&#8217;s been a few years since your last yearly checkup, you\u2019re certainly not alone.<\/p>\n<p>According to Ipsos Reid, less than half of Canadians get regular physical exams. If you\u2019re generally healthy, it might not seem like a big deal. After all, you already have a million things on your plate.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Making time for what\u2019s important \u2013 your health and well-being<\/h2>\n<p>A Sunlife Financial\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sunlife.ca\/static\/canada\/Sponsor\/Bright%20papers\/CHI%20BrightPaper%20E.pdf\">wellness survey<\/a>\u00a0shows 46% of Canadians stating that &#8216;lack of time&#8217; is a top barrier preventing them from living a healthy lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Most people have a ton of urgent things on the go. There&#8217;s that presentation for work next week, driving the kids to gymnastics after school, reading for the professional development course you&#8217;re taking. Not to mention dinner for your parents\u2019 anniversary on the weekend, catching up with your best friend over lunch, taking care of the house &#8211; you might be exhausted just thinking about it. Visiting a doctor for a non-urgent issue might not rank that high on your priority list. But maintaining good health is vital \u2013 for your state of mind, the things you need to do, and your plans for the future. That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple<\/a>\u00a0can help.<\/p>\n<p>Just like Uber, Netflix, and pizza delivery, Maple is online healthcare available on-demand. It\u2019s convenient, with 24\/7 accessibility, which means you can connect with a doctor whenever you have a spare moment. No need to take an afternoon off work, or spend a couple hours in a waiting room with other sniffling, sneezing people. Your Maple doctor can assess your symptoms through live chat or webcam connection and write a prescription for you. They can help come up with a course of treatment, to manage routine health worries and keep them from becoming big problems. And they\u2019ll let you know if your issue needs to be addressed with an in-person visit to a doctor or healthcare practitioner.<\/p>\n<p>While it might not be as glamorous or indulgent as trips to the spa or a long vacation, taking the time to see a doctor is essential to your health, and self-care at its most fundamental. Good health is essential to everything you do and enjoy &#8211; help your doctors take care of you!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take care of yourself so you can take care of business If you&#8217;re like most people, you have a never-ending treadmill of a to-do list.
