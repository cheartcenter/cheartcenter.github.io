A strong support system is essential for coping with the upcoming challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in the position of supporting someone, you\u2019re playing an important role in their hopeful recovery. It\u2019s tough to know the best way you can help. Here are a few places to start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help with everyday tasks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer treatments like radiation and surgery are physically and mentally draining. While the patient is on the mend, they\u2019ll probably appreciate help with everyday things. These can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning the house.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting groceries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking kids to school or extra-curricular activities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparing extra meals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driving the patient to and from doctor appointments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping with pet care, like dog walking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physically demanding housework, like mowing the lawn or shovelling snow.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though these things are nice to do, make sure you ask first. Some people need time alone to process their feelings. It\u2019s tough to suddenly have less independence while in cancer treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional support<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional support involves showing empathy and compassion. You can practice emotional support in a lot of different ways, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listening <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let your friend or loved one take the lead in conversations about their experience. When you\u2019re trying to make someone else comfortable, it can be tempting to draw comparisons between what\u2019s happening to them and something that you\u2019ve gone through. It\u2019s a well-meaning way to relate, but it can make someone feel like they\u2019re not being heard. If someone is opening up to you about their cancer experience, sometimes the best way to support them is to simply listen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expressing that you care<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could be through sending a card, getting together, or a simple phone call. Going the extra mile to let someone know you\u2019re there for them will help them feel less alone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making yourself available <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotions can be tricky. Processing them takes time, and it doesn\u2019t always happen on your schedule. So if you want to be a support to someone with cancer, let them know that you\u2019re available to talk whenever they need you \u2014 morning or night.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggest support groups <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the best support comes from people who have gone through the same thing. Provide resources for where your loved one can find support groups. Here are a few places to start:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/survivornet.ca\/connect\/partners\/breast-cancer-support-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast Cancer Survivor Network Breast Cancer Support Services<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/csl.cancer.ca\/en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Cancer Society Community Services Navigator<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/cancerconnection.ca\/home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Cancer Society Online Support Services<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educate yourself about cancer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Someone who is diagnosed with cancer diagnosis has to take in a lot of new information at once. For some people, their diagnosis could be the first time they\u2019re learning about cancer in detail. Consider doing some research about it yourself as a show of support. It will be easier for your loved one to share information with you if you already know the basics. And, you won\u2019t have to inquire about stressful specifics about the illness from your loved one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep up your support after treatment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning back to everyday life after cancer can be challenging. With any serious illness, it\u2019s common for people to have symptoms of trauma when it\u2019s over. Remember to be gentle with someone who has recently recovered. If you can, continue offering the same support you did when they were diagnosed. They could still be processing what happened for months to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget to care for yourself<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpha.ca\/caregiver-burden-takes-toll-mental-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caregiver burnout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a real thing. It\u2019s when a supportive person becomes mentally, emotionally, and physically fatigued. When you\u2019re pouring your energy into helping other people, you might forget to recharge your own batteries. It\u2019s important to find the time to take care of your own needs. That way, you\u2019ll have energy to keep supporting your friend or loved one through their\u00a0 cancer diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symptoms of caregiver burnout include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional outbursts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty falling asleep.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drinking alcohol or overeating.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling tired all the time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety or depression.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting sick more often.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having no time for other friends, family or socializing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling overwhelmed or hopeless.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling resentful towards the person you\u2019re taking care of.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no shame in feeling exhausted. If you think you might be going through burnout, here\u2019s what you can do:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accept help from others<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone else offers to temporarily take over caregiving duties, say yes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule something that\u2019s just for you<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe it\u2019s seeing a movie, or getting out of the house to visit a friend. Whatever you choose, looking forward to personally rewarding activities can help create a lighter mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access support networks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a caregiver, you\u2019re also on a difficult journey. Here are a few groups for you to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cancerchat.desouzainstitute.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer Chat, an online support group<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecaregivernetwork.ca\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian Caregiver Network<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.familycaregiversbc.ca\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family Caregivers BC<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ottawacancer.ca\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottawa Caregivers<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wellspring.ca\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wellspring<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting someone who\u2019s been diagnosed with cancer will make a big difference in their treatment journey.
