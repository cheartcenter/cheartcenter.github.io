There\u2019s lots of stigma around having an STI, and it can seem like getting one is the end of the world \u2014 or at least the end of your sex life. The pleasant upside is that STIs are treatable. Here\u2019s what to do if you test positive for an STI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is an STI?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sexually transmitted infection or disease (STI or STD), is an infection that\u2019s passed through sexual interaction. You can contract an STI through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, but there doesn\u2019t always have to be penetration \u2014 you can get certain STIs just by touching the affected area. There are a number of STIs out there including, herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, AIDS, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/genital-warts-symptoms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HPV<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/chlamydia-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chlamydia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do I know if I have an STI?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STIs may cause no symptoms at all, or a multitude of symptoms. Because of this, it\u2019s not possible to self-diagnose an STI. Any changes to the genital areas such as unusual discharge, pain, irritation, or bumps should immediately be assessed by a healthcare professional. This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but some symptoms of an STI include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burning during urination.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain during intercourse or ejaculation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unusual vaginal or penile discharge.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rash or lesions on or around the genitals.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Do I have to get tested for an STI?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, STIs can only be diagnosed through laboratory testing. While symptoms can provide clues, they\u2019re not enough to definitively diagnose an STI. Some STIs are asymptomatic, so you\u2019re unlikely to know you\u2019re infected until you get tested. In other cases, symptoms can apply to more than one condition. Pain during urination can happen in both chlamydia and gonorrhea, for example. Or, a symptom may signal something else entirely, like a urinary tract infection. The only way to ensure you get the appropriate treatment is to get tested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might prefer to ignore the symptoms, sexually transmitted infections don\u2019t go away by themselves. Without treatment, many of them can cause further complications, including discomfort, infertility, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sexualhealthontario.ca\/en\/stis#:~:text=If%20you%20or%20your%20partner,STIs%20are%20very%20common.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">life-threatening infections<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and even some forms of cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do I treat a sexually transmitted infection?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not all STIs are curable, all of them are treatable. Depending on what the diagnosis is, your doctor might suggest antibiotics, topical creams, medications, laser therapy, or cryotherapy (freezing). But, you need a diagnosis to make sure you\u2019re getting the right treatment. Antibiotics prescribed for chlamydia won\u2019t treat genital warts, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prevention is also a strategy when it comes to protecting yourself against STIs. In Canada, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/prevention-and-screening\/reduce-cancer-risk\/make-informed-decisions\/get-vaccinated\/all-about-hpv-vaccines\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three different vaccines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are available to protect against HPV infections, and they can be offered to children as young as nine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do I really have to call all my exes?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is certainly one of the great fears behind contracting an STI. While it\u2019s tempting to keep the information to yourself, you shouldn\u2019t. Both you and any partners you have need treatment for an STI at the same time. Otherwise, you risk passing it back and forth between yourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve had more than one sexual partner, it\u2019s possible that each partner since your last STI test is infected. They could in turn, be infecting their new sexual partners without realizing it, who could be infecting their new partners, and well, you get the idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that you don\u2019t have to call your former partners yourself. In many cases, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/infectious-diseases\/sexual-health-sexually-transmitted-infections\/canadian-guidelines\/sexually-transmitted-infections\/canadian-guidelines-sexually-transmitted-infections-17.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Health Agency of Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will do it for you. A contact tracer from Public Health will ask you about any previous sexual partners within a certain time frame so they can notify them. Don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t disclose your name or contact info. Your former partners won\u2019t know that they\u2019re being contacted because of you. In cases where it might not be safe for public health to alert a previous sexual partner \u2014 like if there&#8217;s risk of violence \u2014 safety always takes precedence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Does my STI mean my partner is cheating on me?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This really depends on what the STI is. Certain infections can go undetected for a long time. Men with HPV may never know that they have it until their female partner develops irregular cells on their cervix. Each sexually transmitted infection has its own set of complexities.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to press your doctor to make sure you fully understand the details. Don\u2019t assume your partner has been unfaithful until you\u2019ve discussed it with your doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can I ever have sex again?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sexually transmitted infections fall into one of two camps \u2014 those that disappear and never come back, and those that are treatable but not curable. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/sti-rates-canada-1.5230987\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two of the most common STIs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Canada, and they\u2019re both curable with antibiotics. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/genital-herpes-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herpes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/hiv-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0fall into the second category \u2014 they can\u2019t be cured. That\u2019s not to say that they aren\u2019t treatable. With the proper medications and precautions, it\u2019s possible to have safe sex with a new partner. It\u2019s crucial to speak with your doctor to understand how to do this safely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you test positive for an STI, the best thing to do is to pick your doctor\u2019s brain about the diagnosis. They\u2019ll be able to tell you how to treat it, and how to protect yourself in future sexual encounters. The worst thing you can do is ignore the symptoms of an STI. It can feel embarrassing to talk about STIs with your doctor, but you\u2019re definitely not the first to do it and you won\u2019t be the last.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning that you\u2019ve tested positive for a sexually transmitted infection can be a gut punch.
