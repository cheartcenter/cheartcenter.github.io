It is both safe and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.plannedparenthood.org\/learn\/birth-control\/birth-control-pill\/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">99 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> effective at preventing pregnancy (with perfect use), but despite its many benefits, the pill isn\u2019t for everyone. Certain lifestyle factors and health issues can make taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) risky. But since all forms of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birth control<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/birth-control-options-and-side-effects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits and risks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we thought we\u2019d take a\u00a0look at the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pros and cons of birth control pills<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does the pill work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pill works by preventing your body from releasing an egg each month, so there\u2019s nothing for your partner\u2019s sperm to fertilize. As an added level of protection, the pill thickens your cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus even if an egg is released. Finally, some kinds of oral contraception also affect the lining of your uterus to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting. The pill does all this by introducing hormones into your body\u00a0\u2014 usually estrogen and progestin (the combination pill) or progestin alone (the mini-pill).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The pros of the birth control pill<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pill is a convenient way to prevent pregnancy. Once you start taking the pill, you\u2019re protected against pregnancy within<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.plannedparenthood.org\/learn\/birth-control\/birth-control-pill\/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill#targetText=But%20depending%20on%20when%20you,for%20up%20to%207%20days.&amp;targetText=If%20you%20start%20combination%20pills,protected%20from%20pregnancy%20right%20away.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven days<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While you do\u00a0need a prescription for the pill, you don\u2019t have to book an appointment to have it inserted or removed like with an IUD \u2014 which can be quite\u00a0uncomfortable. And you can choose to\u00a0go off of it at any point.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of fringe <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to oral <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contraception<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The pill is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK279209\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highly effective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at reducing both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, for example. It can also regulate and lighten your periods and reduce cramps, which can be especially appealing for women with irregular, heavy, or painful flows. There are even certain brands of birth control pills that let you skip your periods completely. They typically involve taking the pill continuously for 84 days at a time, so you only get your period once every 12 weeks. This is particularly\u00a0helpful for women with anemia, extreme PMS symptoms, or endometriosis. And, yes, it is totally\u00a0safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The cons of birth control pills<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are certainly\u00a0many advantages to the pill, birth control pills do\u00a0have certain disadvantages. For instance, the pill only works if you remember to take it. Unfortunately, research shows that when it comes to OCP, women forget to take it<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8853280\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more often<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than they may realize. If you find yourself forgetting to take your pill, you may want to\u00a0set up some sort of\u00a0reminder system or alarm. There are also a number of apps that can help you remember.<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1570495741942_6502838516716494\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span> But if you know that you have difficulty sticking to a routine, you might want to\u00a0consider another birth control method.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many prescription drugs, the pill\u2019s efficacy changes based on interactions with some other medications. St. John\u2019s Wort, for example, is notorious for reducing the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15914127\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pill\u2019s effectiveness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist to ensure you\u2019re not taking anything that can affect the potency of your birth control. And if you are, make sure to\u00a0use a backup method of contraception. Using a barrier method of birth control is good practice because the pill doesn\u2019t protect against sexually transmitted infections.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The medical risks of oral contraception<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2015010\/article\/14222-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three quarters<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of women take the pill at some point, and the vast majority experience few negative side effects. For the most part, the pill is both safe and one of the most successful ways of preventing pregnancy. Despite this, the pill does have some risks. It can increase your risk of venous thrombosis (also known as blood clots) or stroke by<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stoptheclot.org\/about-clots\/webinar_contra\/birth_control_clots\/#targetText=Although%20they%20do%20not%20cause,a%20progestin%20(synthetic%20progesterone).&amp;targetText=The%20new%20patches%20(transdermal%20contraceptives,increase%20this%20risk%20even%20more.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three to four<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> times. For\u00a0women\u00a0over 35 who smoke, however, the risks of taking the pill\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10368521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase significantly<\/a>, to the point\u00a0where it is no longer considered safe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<span id=\"selectionBoundary_1570495918603_35136754892822153\" class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" style=\"line-height: 0; display: none;\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain health conditions may also preclude safe use of the pill. If you&#8217;ve had previous heart problems or blood clots, speak to your doctor about which contraception methods may suit you better. The same goes for diabetes, migraines with aura, and breast cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study also confirms a link between using the pill and developing depression. While the increased risk is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/blog\/can-hormonal-birth-control-trigger-depression-2016101710514\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More research needed<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the pill is a hormone-based contraceptive, it can, in some cases, affect your level of sexual desire. Female sexual arousal is notoriously difficult to study, and different research studies have yielded<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6421036\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">different results<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some show that OCP lowers desire, while others indicate that the pill heightens sexual arousal. Still others show no difference. Until more research provides consensus, it\u2019s impossible to say how the pill will affect your libido but it\u2019s worth being aware that it is a possible side effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in need of further study, is how well the pill works for women who are considered obese. Obesity causes several physiological changes, which may affect the efficacy of the pill. One study found that obese women may have a<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fredhutch.org\/en\/news\/releases\/2004\/12\/obesity_pill.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60 to 70 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> higher chance of getting pregnant while taking the pill than women considered to be a healthy weight. If you fall into this category, it\u2019s crucial to discuss the issue further with your doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The long-term side effects of birth control pills<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many pill users stay on it for long periods of time, leading to concerns about longitudinal consequences. Thankfully, long-term use of the pill has<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2812881\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no effect<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on your ability to get pregnant once you go off of it. And when it comes to other consequences, it\u2019s up for debate: using the pill for five or more years can<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736(07)61684-5\/fulltext\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase your risk<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of developing cervical cancer, but this risk disappears once you\u2019ve been off it for 10 years. And what\u2019s interesting is that OCP use lowers your overall risk of developing endometrial cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as you remember to take it, the pill is safe and effective at preventing pregnancy. Given its additional benefits, it\u2019s clear why it\u2019s been the most popular form of birth control for over 50 years. If you\u2019re thinking of going on the pill, have an open and honest conversation with your doctor about your lifestyle and any underlying health issues. They\u2019ll be able to advise you on whether the pill is right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The birth control pill has been around for decades.
