While the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signs and symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">genital warts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seem like they\u2019d be pretty obvious, they can be quite sneaky. It\u2019s actually possible to catch them even when your partner has no visible signs. So how can you protect yourself if you don\u2019t know what to look for? Let\u2019s take a look at how genital warts spread, how you can avoid infection, and what to do if you do catch them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Causes of genital warts<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The human papillomavirus (or HPV), is responsible for all the warts we get on our bodies. There are over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-and-cervical-cancer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 different strains<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of HPV, and it\u2019s almost impossible to keep from coming into contact with one of them at some point in our lives. Most forms of the virus don\u2019t cause any symptoms or issues, while some result in warts on our hands or feet. And two strains \u2014 HPV-6 and HPV-11 \u2014 cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nyulangone.org\/conditions\/human-papillomavirus-in-adults\/types\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of cases of genital warts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are also 14 or more strains of HPV that typically <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/cancer\/hpv\/basic_info\/index.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cause cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, none of these are the ones that cause genital warts. So although genital warts can be awkward and embarrassing, they aren\u2019t usually lethal. We actually refer to these strains as \u201clow risk.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How will I know if I have genital warts?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The symptoms of genital warts are tricky and elusive. You\u2019re only likely to notice that you have genital warts if you have a visible outbreak, but you can have a case without any symptoms. Warts can show up alone or in a group, and vary in colour: they can be skin tone, a bit darker, or white. Texture-wise they can be either smooth or bumpy (like cauliflower). They\u2019re most easily spotted on the penis, scrotum, vulva, or buttocks. But genital warts can also show up inside the vagina, anus, mouth, or throat, meaning they might not necessarily be visible. In those cases, you might notice other symptoms, such as unusual vaginal discharge or itching. Thankfully, warts don\u2019t usually cause discomfort, but if picked at they might become painful and can also bleed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do genital warts spread?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genital warts are transmitted by direct contact. This means you can\u2019t catch genital warts from hugging, kissing, sharing drinks, towels, baths, or cutlery or from swimming pools or toilet seats. However, you can catch them from sharing sex toys. You\u2019re most likely to get genital warts from vaginal or anal sex (and sometimes, from oral sex) with an infected partner. This is true even if they don\u2019t have any visible warts (although genital warts are more contagious during an outbreak). You also don\u2019t have to have sex to pass them on: touching the affected area is enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is there a cure for genital warts?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is currently no cure for genital warts. Some infected people have recurrent flare ups throughout their lives, while others might only have a single occurrence. Some individuals never actually develop visible genital warts themselves, but can still pass it to their sexual partners. For most people, though, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fpa.org.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/genital-warts-information-and-advice.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virus will eventually pass<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through and out of their system in anywhere from a couple of months to 2 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can take months, or sometimes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw105401\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for genital warts to show up after you are infected, so it\u2019s possible to catch them and never know when you contracted them, or from whom.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to stay protected<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genital warts are extremely contagious. In fact, HPV is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/hpv\/stdfact-hpv.htm#targetText=HPV%20is%20the%20most%20common,many%20different%20types%20of%20HPV.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most prevalent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sexually transmitted infection in North America. Because of this, it\u2019s crucial to take precautions. You should always use condoms with new sexual partners. But be warned: condoms are not 100% effective against genital warts. The virus cannot penetrate the latex, but if there are warts elsewhere on the genitals, it can still be transmitted. They are very effective against other STIs, so don\u2019t use this vulnerability as an excuse to skip them. If you think that you or your partner has a suspicious bump or marking, don\u2019t have sex (or any kind of sexual contact), until you\u2019re able to see a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a boy between the ages of nine and 26 or a girl between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/infectious-diseases\/sexual-health-sexually-transmitted-infections\/hpv-prevention-vaccines-questions-answers.html#a3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nine and 45<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health Canada recommends that you receive the HPV vaccine (if you haven\u2019t already). This vaccine protects against several strains responsible for cancer, as well as those that cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/hpv\/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most genital warts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many provinces have free vaccination programs for school-aged children as without vaccination, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/update-recommended-human-papillomavirus-vaccine-immunization-schedule.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seventy-five percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of sexually active Canadians end up with a sexually transmitted HPV infection at some point in their lives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you have genital warts or may have been exposed to them, you need to see a doctor. You should never treat genital warts with the same over-the-counter solutions used for other types of warts, or any other home remedies. Your doctor can either prescribe a topical treatment or remove them using cryotherapy or a laser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no cure for genital warts, so reducing your risk of infection is your best option. Most sexually active individuals get at least one strain of sexually transmitted HPV at some point in their lives (unless they get the vaccine early enough). While genital warts can be embarrassing, the truth is they can affect everyone and anyone who is sexually active. They\u2019re that common. Don\u2019t be afraid to speak to a doctor; treatment options are available to help manage your symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The symptoms of genital warts might not be as obvious as you think.
