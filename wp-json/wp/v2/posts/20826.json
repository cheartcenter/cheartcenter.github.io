Wearing a mask, social distancing, enduring lockdowns, the whole nine yards. While you\u2019ve worked hard to protect yourself from COVID-19, the virus became even more contagious, mutating into what\u2019s known as COVID-19 variants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what makes a variant different from the already contagious COVID-19 virus? And just how contagious are these variants? We\u2019re going to break it all down for you so you\u2019re armed with the information you need to stay safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why COVID-19 variants have appeared<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. All viruses evolve over time, and when a virus replicates, a slight change called a mutation can take place. When a virus goes through one or more new mutations, it&#8217;s called a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/feature-stories\/detail\/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnKvcqCjcKfJSY3L33zsAAKkEcaND4ck7s-bkWZB4Twk6uT0R6aCfaYaAga-EALw_wcB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">variant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With COVID-19 circulating in a population and infecting many people, the likelihood of mutation increases. This is why multiple variants from around the world have appeared.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What makes the variants so contagious?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019d love to say \u201cback off variant, you aren\u2019t that special\u201d, variants have unique attributes that could make it easier for you to become infected. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is the spike protein that penetrates host cells, which causes infection. With a variant, there are mutations in the spike protein that allow it to stick to the cells much more easily. This means the variant is more easily transmissible, and could be more successful at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/variants-askcbc-feb19-1.5918554\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making you sick<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re exposed to one of the variants, you could become infected in a shorter amount of time. That\u2019s why limiting interactions with others, wearing a mask, and maintaining physical distance are all important safety measures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the different variants?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.publichealthontario.ca\/en\/about\/blog\/2021\/monitoring-covid-19-voc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three variants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have surfaced in Canada, as well as one <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/docs\/default-source\/coronaviruse\/situation-reports\/20210225_weekly_epi_update_voc-special-edition.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">variant of interest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first variant, B.1.1.7, emerged in the U.K, and the first two cases in Canada were recorded in December of 2020. The second variant was B.1.351, first identified in South Africa, recorded here in January of 2021. The third variant was P.1, first seen in Brazil, recorded here in February of 2021. Studies have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-021-03426-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirmed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than other variants. However, it has not been proven yet to lead to any change in the severity of illness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In March of 2021, a new variant of interest called B.1.617, first detected in India, was recorded in Canada as well. You may have heard this variant of interest referred to as the \u201cdouble mutant\u201d \u2013<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that\u2019s because this specific variant carries two mutations. Up until now, mutations were spotted separately in other variants, never together. So far, 39 cases of B.1.617 have been reported in British Columbia, 36 in Ontario, 5 in Quebec, as well as 1 case each in Alberta, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, B.1.1.7 has been the most <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nccid.ca\/covid-19-variants\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">publicly reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> variant, with 90,515 cases across the country. There have been 3,180 reported cases of the P.1 variant, and 541 of the B.1.351 variant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can you get sick from a variant if you\u2019ve already had COVID-19?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve already recovered from COVID-19, you may not be fully protected against the variants. More research is needed, but a report from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/conditions-and-diseases\/coronavirus\/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know#:~:text=Those%20who%20did%20have%20the,1.351%20variant%20was%20spreading%20there.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johns Hopkins Medicine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that when it comes to the B.1.351 variant specifically, even if you\u2019ve had COVID-19 previously, you may still be at risk. While it has not been shown to cause more severe illness, health experts say there is a chance you could still become mildly or moderately ill.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Will a variant make you more ill?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/961037\/NERVTAG_note_on_B.1.1.7_severity_for_SAGE_77__1_.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no conclusive evidence<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that any of the variants will cause more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. The key thing to remember here is that the variants are more <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contagious<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know it can be tedious hearing people say \u201cwash your hands, keep your distance, wear a mask\u201d, but it is so important to continue following these protocols to help keep you safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Will the vaccine continue to work against all variants?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 vaccines currently being administered across Canada are expected to give at least some<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/feature-stories\/detail\/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnLHZTod9XF7SOXVbJEmBM8l7f4sqhImFeiO_P10NdrCCcrbawfFHogaAiEOEALw_wcB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protection against the variants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If any of the vaccines are proven to be less effective against one or more variants, changes to the vaccine\u2019s composition can be made. That being said, it\u2019s important to continue to keep your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands to reduce your risk of getting sick.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do you protect yourself from a COVID-19 variant?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting vaccinated and following safety guidelines is your best line of defence against COVID-19 variants. If you\u2019re concerned about exposure or are not feeling well, get tested right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if you live in the Greater Toronto Area, Calgary, or Halifax, you can get a COVID-19 test quickly and conveniently for travel, work, or other reasons.
