For family caregivers, this caregiving is unpaid. You may be helping a partner or spouse, an aging parent, a child with special needs, a relative, a friend, or a neighbour.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What does caregiving look like?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caregiving tasks can be straightforward such as driving someone to medical appointments or picking up or dropping off groceries or medication, which could translate into an hour or so a week. They can also be more intensive, such as helping with daily living tasks like bathing, getting dressed, and eating. Caregiving almost always includes providing emotional support. When caregiving is intensive, it&#8217;s equivalent to a part-time \u2013 or even full-time \u2013 job in addition to your other responsibilities, such as work or your own family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These factors contribute to making the experience of caregiving more challenging than it was for previous generations. That being said, helping someone who has care needs can feel like the most natural thing in the world. If your partner or spouse has an illness or disease, you of course do your part in caring for them.\u00a0Similarly, if aging parents need help with different tasks, many adult children &#8220;naturally&#8221; step up to provide care.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why you need caregiver support, and when it&#8217;s time to reach out for help<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a diagnosis of a serious illness or disease, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, kidney disease, or dementia.
