You may be born with them, and new ones form as you get older. Most new moles aren\u2019t cause for concern, but monitoring their appearance is a good practice. It helps with early detection of melanoma \u2014 a deadly type of skin cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are moles?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moles are skin growths that commonly form in utero or during your first year after birth. They\u2019re the result of a cluster of melanocytes in one place on your skin. Melanocytes are the cells that make the pigment melanin. They\u2019re what gives your moles their colour \u2014 typically a shade of brown that\u2019s darker than your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melanoma and skin cancer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melanoma is a type of cancer affecting the skin, eyes, and intestines. It begins in the melanocytes. These cells begin to multiply at a rapid rate, leading to the formation of tumours. These tumours can sometimes resemble moles. This is why it\u2019s good to be familiar with the moles on your body. You can spot new changes quickly, and contact a doctor as soon as you notice anything unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk factors for skin cancer include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age between 35-75.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light skin.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde or red hair.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having more than 50 moles.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having large moles, greater than two inches in diameter.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noticing new moles, or that your moles are changing in size or shape.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family or personal history of skin cancer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having severe sun damage in the past.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of tanning bed use.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer if left untreated. Luckily, with early detection it\u2019s very treatable. The average success rate of curing melanoma through early detection is about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skincancer.org\/skin-cancer-information\/skin-cancer-facts\/#:~:text=The%20estimated%20five%2Dyear%20survival,disease%20metastasizes%20to%20distant%20organs.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">99%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking your moles for cancer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ABCDE method can be used to check moles for signs of melanoma. Here\u2019s what to look for:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A \u2013 asymmetry. If one part of your mole is a very different shape than the other, it\u2019s a sign of melanoma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B \u2013 border. Raised or scalloped borders are unusual in moles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C \u2013 colour. Healthy moles tend to be a uniform shade of brown. Dark moles, or moles with many colours, might be cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D \u2013 diameter. Pay special attention to any moles you have that are larger than six millimeters across.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E \u2013 evolution. A mole that suddenly appears, grows, or changes colour or shape should be examined by a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of moles<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congenital Mole<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congenital moles are moles that you\u2019ve had since birth. They\u2019re round or oval patches on the skin that are sometimes slightly raised. These moles vary in shape, size and colour. Especially during puberty, or periods where your body undergoes a hormonal shift, it\u2019s normal for the appearance of these moles to change. Typical changes include hair growth on the mole and small raised bumps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With congenital moles, the likelihood of cancer depends on the mole\u2019s size. Anything larger than 5cm across is considered a giant mole. One large mole with many satellite moles falls under the same category. People with moles of this size are at a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3900335\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of skin cancer, but giant moles are rare. Otherwise, congenital moles are at low risk for becoming cancerous.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atypical Mole<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These moles are also called dysplastic moles. They\u2019re similar in colour to congenital moles. What sets them apart is their shape. Their perimeter is uneven, which is a characteristic of cancerous moles too. Even though atypical moles are not necessarily cancerous, keep a closer eye on yours for signs of melanoma. Since they\u2019re not a uniform growth, signs of cancer can be easier to miss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquired Mole<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An acquired mole is simply a mole that appears after birth. This isn\u2019t unusual, and most acquired moles don\u2019t become cancerous.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re small and circular with a fairly even shape. Their colours are similar to those of a congenital mole \u2014 shades of tan or brown that are darker than the rest of your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New moles in adults<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new mole isn\u2019t automatically cause for alarm. They often form during hormone changes, like during pregnancy or as you enter old age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since new growths on the skin can sometimes be melanomas, monitoring new moles is important. New moles have a higher likelihood of becoming cancerous than moles you\u2019ve had since birth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mole mapping<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/mole-mapping\/\">Mole mapping<\/a> is a way of screening your skin for the presence of cancerous moles. One in six Canadians will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, and early intervention makes a big difference in recovery. Mole scanning technology like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/mole-mapping\/\">FotoFinder ATBM Master<\/a> digitally scans the moles and other birthmarks on your body. Using artificial intelligence, it then flags skin abnormalities that are cause for concern. Reports from the scan are reviewed by your dermatologist, who can advise on treatment for any concerning growths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An annual visit to the dermatologist to have your moles examined is recommended, especially if you have any of the above-mentioned risk factors for melanoma.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagnosis and treatment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a mole is thought to be cancerous, your doctor will do a skin biopsy. That\u2019s when a small sample of skin tissue from the mole is removed and sent to a laboratory for testing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your mole turns out to be melanoma, the next thing the doctor will determine is which stage of cancer it has progressed to. Cancer has four stages. In the early stages, cancer hasn\u2019t spread past the original site. This is easier to treat and normally involves surgically removing the cancerous mole. In later stages, cancer has usually formed a large tumour or spread to other parts of the body. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-type\/skin-melanoma\/treatment\/?region=on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for treating cancer at this stage include radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By getting familiar with the moles on your body and checking them often, you\u2019ll reduce your chances of developing later-stage skin cancer. New moles aren\u2019t a bad thing. They\u2019re just something to keep an eye on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in receiving a mole mapping scan to thoroughly check all the moles on your body, book an appointment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/mole-mapping\/\">Mole mapping<\/a> is quick, non-invasive, and uses the newest technology.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s normal to find new moles on your body as you get older.
