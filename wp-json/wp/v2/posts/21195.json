Often before an exam, or a major work deadline. Knowing you\u2019re about to spend the next few hours \u2014 or more \u2014 in intense pain is awful. It\u2019s even more inconvenient when stress is what brought your migraine on in the first place. Why do migraines and stress go together so often?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is migraine?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migraine is a condition characterized by severe, recurrent headaches, but migraine symptoms aren\u2019t confined to just throbbing head pain. Many people who experience migraines also report nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and even sweating and diarrhea. They often experience something called a migraine aura as a precursor to their episode. These auras often manifest as visual disturbances, dizziness, or ringing in the ears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While different people report different triggers for their migraines, we don\u2019t yet know what migraines\u2019 underlying cause is. Scientists speculate that it might be due to abnormal brain activity affecting the nerves and blood vessels of the brain. In spite of the knowledge gap on their cause, we know that migraines are pretty common \u2014 more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/24941316\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadians have one at some point or another. They\u2019re also more likely to affect women \u2014 especially those in their 30s and 40s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are migraines serious?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t get migraines, you may think they\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d headaches. But migraines can range in both severity and frequency, and are often debilitating. While some people who experience migraines report infrequent headaches, others find themselves afflicted much more frequently, with a subset reporting daily migraines. While many migraines might last for a few hours, some remain for days at a time. People who experience migraines often report that they\u2019re unable to work, drive or participate in their usual activities when an attack comes on. In fact, migraines are the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainecanada.org\/disability-and-migraine\/#:~:text=Among%20Canadian%20employees%2C%2056%25%20had,25%25%20reported%20being%20disabled.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third leading cause of missed workdays<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Canada, coming in after back pain and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6337984\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mood disorders<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 which they often go hand-in-hand with.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Stress and migraines<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3475609\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people who experience migraines report stress as one of their triggers, especially when it comes to those experiencing daily migraine attacks. One theory is that the migraine brain is hypersensitive \u2014 potentially one of the reasons why light can make a migraine attack so much worse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migraines and stress can often become a vicious circle; stress precipitates migraine, and the migraine episode itself causes more stress. We know that people who experience migraines are more likely to have depression or anxiety, but much like the connection between stress and migraines, it\u2019s unclear how exactly they\u2019re related. In other words, are the anxiety and depression related to the way the migraine brain works, or does living with migraine cause those disorders? Either way, be sure to tell your doctor if you have both migraines and another condition such as anxiety. It\u2019s often beneficial to treat the two in tandem.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What else can trigger migraines?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While stress is a major contributor to migraines, it\u2019s only one of a number of triggers \u2014 even weather changes can bring on a migraine episode. Recording your migraine attacks and what preceded them may help you to narrow down your triggers, especially if they include food or certain activities. Other potential migraine triggers include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormonal fluctuations, like getting your period.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain medications, including the combination pill.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of sleep or changes in sleep patterns, like jet lag.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain foods, especially ones containing nitrates.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dehydration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staring at a screen for too long.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too much caffeine.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to prevent a stress migraine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to prevent a stress migraine is to deal with your stress preemptively, whenever possible. Start by making sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. Next, make a list of any potential stressors and see if you\u2019re able to break them up into smaller, more manageable pieces. Set aside time for stress-busting activities like exercise, meditation, and quality, screen-free time with your nearest and dearest. Dysregulation can be a migraine trigger, so sticking to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep schedule<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and eating regular meals made from whole foods is also crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel an attack coming on, you can try to head it off by lying down in a darkened room, or drinking a caffeinated beverage. Once your migraine is in full effect, however, many report that the only thing that offers relief is medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to worry about your migraine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you experience regular migraines, it\u2019s best to speak with a healthcare provider \u2014 if you haven\u2019t already \u2014 to rule out any other potential issues. You should also see a doctor if you develop migraine auras in your 40s or later, if you\u2019ve never had them previously. As well, if your migraines have become more frequent or debilitating, cause personality changes, or prevent you from completing daily tasks, it\u2019s time to see a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress is fine in small doses, but too much stress, over too long a period can wreak havoc on you. For people who experience migraines, dealing with stress before it overwhelms you is one of the most powerful tools you have. Life \u2014 especially pandemic life \u2014 makes it impossible to avoid stress. But you can stop your stress from getting out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Migraines occur when you can least afford them.
