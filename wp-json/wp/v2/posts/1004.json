Acetaminophen is over-the-counter medication, with multiple well-known brands selling it, including Tylenol. Acetaminophen is universally considered to be a safe first line treatment for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/fever-treatment\/\">fever<\/a>, and it should be\u00a0given regularly every 4 hours. I always recommend parents use Acetaminophen proactively since\u00a0it is always better to act early before the fever rises. In terms of\u00a0dosage, it\u2019s important to know that most bottles tend to under-dose. The best way to get effective relief is to use your child\u2019s weight for appropriate dosing. The correct dosing here is 15 mg\/kg, every 4 hours.<\/p>\n<h2>Second line of fever treatment: Ibuprofen<\/h2>\n<p>Ibuprofen, commonly recognized as Advil or Motrin, is a great second line medication to add when your child doesn\u2019t get adequate fever control from Acetaminophen alone. Again,\u00a0the best guide to dosing is your child\u2019s weight. The correct dosing here is 10 mg\/kg, every 6 hours. The good news is that your child can take Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen together. They do not interact with each other since different organs in our bodies are responsible for metabolizing these medications.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above,\u00a0ensure your child is drinking fluids and getting adequate rest to allow the immune system to do its job properly. Consider seeking urgent medical attention if a fever lasts longer than five days or if you don\u2019t see relief from these medications.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fever In Children: Everything You Need To Know About Treatment\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Gf9MXSWqZvA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\">Maple:<\/a> Our mission is to help people feel better faster, while empowering patients with more healthcare choice and control.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Entry\u00a0by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/doctors\">Dr. Brett Belchetz<\/a>\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0CEO and practicing emergency room physician in Toronto, with extensive experience in both adult and paediatric medicine.
