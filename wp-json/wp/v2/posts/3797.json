This year we\u2019re also coping with the stress of COVID-19. With this difficult combination, it\u2019s important to take extra care of our mental health this season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those winter blahs \u2014 eating more, sleeping more, and having less energy \u2014 are something lots of us experience. For some people, seasonal mood changes turn into more serious depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Here\u2019s what you need to know about SAD, and how you can ease the symptoms of winter blues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SAD is a clinical depression brought on by the change of season. It usually begins during the fall months, when the days start getting noticeably shorter. As winter approaches symptoms become more severe. They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling sad for most of the day, almost every day.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiredness during the day.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight gain.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food cravings, usually for foods that are sugary or starchy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling irritable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling hopeless or guilty.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer enjoying the company of friends and family.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s rare, but some people experience SAD in the summer months. In those cases, feelings of sadness usually come in the springtime and get stronger as the summer months approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What causes seasonal affective disorder?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical professionals still haven\u2019t discovered exactly why people get SAD, but we do have some idea of how it affects the body. There are two chemicals that are imbalanced in people who get SAD in the wintertime \u2014 serotonin and melatonin. The third component to SAD is a disruption to your circadian rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serotonin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serotonin is a chemical your brain produces called a neurotransmitter. It\u2019s responsible for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motor function<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing anxiety and depression<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stabilizing mood<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regulating appetite and sleep cycles<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased focus<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serotonin levels are affected by exposure to sunlight. In wintertime, the short days and lack of sun cause a drop in serotonin production. This contributes to emotional disturbances like sadness and irritability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melatonin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melatonin is a hormone that your brain produces. It\u2019s created in response to darkness, and it helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle. When your melatonin levels are healthy, you wake up and fall asleep at appropriate hours without any trouble. With SAD, melatonin is released at the wrong time because it\u2019s dark outside more often. This can leave you feeling tired and prone to sleeping at inconvenient times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Circadian Rhythm<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your sleep-wake cycle is disrupted, over time it affects your circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is your internal clock. It tells your body when it should be tired and when it should wake up. Sunlight is one of the ways your circadian rhythm stays on track. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2768314\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially in the morning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, light helps your internal clock understand it\u2019s daytime. Low light in the wintertime can confuse your circadian rhythm. Without cues from natural light, you\u2019re at risk of oversleeping.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who is at risk for seasonal affective disorder?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cmha.bc.ca\/documents\/seasonal-affective-disorder-2\/#:~:text=About%202%20to%203%25%20of,10%25%20of%20all%20depression%20cases.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian adults experience SAD once in their lives. This isn\u2019t mild seasonal sadness \u2014 it\u2019s depression that disrupts daily life. About 15% of Canadians will have a lighter version of SAD that\u2019s manageable enough to live life normally.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are more likely to develop SAD than men. Luckily, as you get older, your risk of SAD decreases. Other risk factors include living in places that are far from the equator, and a family history of depression or SAD.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ways to cope with seasonal affective disorder<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your doctor can help you narrow down the best treatment for you if you have SAD. Here are some common options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light therapy\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting next to a bright lamp built specifically for SAD relief can help correct chemical imbalances. SAD lamps are used at home, usually for about 30 minutes each day. Although it\u2019s possible to purchase a lamp without a prescription, checking in with your doctor first may help you avoid side effects like headaches and nausea.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medication\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people who experience depression use medication to help them feel their best. Sometimes people with SAD start taking medication in late summer to get ahead of the changes in mood brought on by winter months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychotherapy\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting regular support during the winter months can help you manage symptoms like negative thoughts. Counselling is a great way to put your seasonal depression into perspective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle adjustments\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are things you can work into your routines that relieve symptoms of depression. Physical activity releases chemicals like endorphins that improve your mood. Eating a diet low in sugar helps regulate your hormones, which also keep your emotions level. Experiment with healthy lifestyle practices a few times a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonal affective disorder and COVID-19<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve all spent a lot more time indoors than usual this year. Especially if you have SAD, getting out into the daylight will help with winter blues. Even though we need to be socially distanced, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to stay inside. Try a winter hike with your pet, or a socially distanced walk with friends or family. Exercise, daylight, and social connection will boost your mood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonal affective disorder makes it tough to be your best self. Lack of light can leave you feeling sluggish and even depressed. If you\u2019re feeling low, don\u2019t ignore it. With the right combination of supports, you can make the most of a challenging season.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Canadian winters are tough for a lot of reasons.
