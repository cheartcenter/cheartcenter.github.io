Everyone has different tastes, desires, and hangups. Some have one sexual partner for their entire lives, while others see lovers come and go. Despite this wide range of \u201cnormal,\u201d many feel like they have to lie, deny, or exaggerate when it comes to how many people they\u2019ve slept with. But, outside of societal expectations, is it possible to have too many bedfellows? When it comes to sex, how many sexual partners is \u201ctoo many?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different strokes for different folks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Western society is structured around the monogamous couple, where both partners commit to being only with one another. Polyamory, however, has become increasingly popular over the last few years \u2014 or at least more widely talked about. Polyamory is the practice of having more than one committed, romantic and\/or sexual relationship at the same time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monogamy and polyamory aren\u2019t the only options though. Some individuals prefer to have serial sexual relationships, seeing each partner once, or only a few times. Others choose to opt out of sexual relationships entirely, or at least for periods of time. While your great-aunt Shirley might not approve, any of these models is fine as long as it\u2019s working for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many partners does the average Canadian have?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to gauge how much sex Canadians are actually having. The internet claims that millennials are having less sex than previous generations, but that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2020\/feb\/03\/quality-over-quantity-gen-zs-sex-recession-looks-more-like-an-upturn#:~:text=Just%2037%25%20report%20having%20sex%20once%20a%20month%20or%20more.&amp;text=This%20is%20a%20huge%20difference,of%20those%20in%20their%2030s.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might not be as true<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the headlines make out. And what about their Boomer and Gen X parents and the rest of the generations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what do the stats say? The latest Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), reports that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2020009\/article\/00001-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">37%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of sexually active 15-24-year-olds had more than one partner in the last year. Finding out the number of lifetime partners Canadians are likely to have though, is more difficult. Our government doesn\u2019t keep statistics on that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get a sense of how many sexual partners the average Canadian has, we had to turn to Durex. Their 2007-2008 survey on sexual habits claims that Canadian males average <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/news\/canada\/are-we-blushing-yet\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23 sexual partners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over their lifetime, while Canadian women have around 10. Keep in mind, though, that this survey isn\u2019t super recent, and like most surveys on sexual behaviour, its participant sample wasn\u2019t very large. In other words, the survey might not be as reflective of Canadian sexual behaviour as it appears.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex comes with risk<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the number of partners you have, relationships can be hard. You have to compromise and take your partner&#8217;s feelings into account. But even when feelings aren\u2019t involved \u2014 and when are feelings not involved \u2014 sex is still risky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anytime you\u2019re in a sexual relationship with another person, it\u2019s good to\u00a0 take precautions against <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/sexually-transmitted-infections-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexually transmitted infections<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (STIs). The more sexual partners you have, the more you increase the possibility of contracting an STI. Having one committed sexual partner is safer than having multiple partners, but monogamous relationships aren\u2019t risk-free either. You and your partner should be tested for STIs before beginning a sexual relationship. And, you should monitor yourselves for signs or symptoms of STIs such as lumps, bumps, sores, changes in discharge, or pain in the genitals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No conversation about sex is complete without mentioning the risk of pregnancy. If you\u2019re sexually active and don\u2019t want to get pregnant, speak to your healthcare provider about your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/birth-control-options-and-side-effects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birth control options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Using condoms as well as another form of birth control is the best way to protect against unwanted pregnancy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can I have safe sex?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While certain precautions can make sex safer, sex is never 100% risk free. Anytime you engage in a sexual encounter with someone, even a person you know well, there\u2019s a possibility that you could contract an STI. Using hormonal birth control or a diaphragm can reduce your chances of getting pregnant, but condoms are the only form of birth control that helps to protect you against STIs. But even condoms don\u2019t protect against STIs like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/genital-warts-symptoms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">genital warts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can develop outside of areas that the condom covers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how to make sex safer? For starters, use a condom each and every time you have sex. Don\u2019t take alchohol or drugs before having sex. Getting drunk or high can lower your inhibitions, pushing you to make decisions you wouldn\u2019t if you were sober. And, make sure to pay attention to your partner\u2019s genitals as well as your own. Notice any lumps, bumps or sores? Don\u2019t have sex until you or your partner have been tested by a healthcare professional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of sexual partners you have is entirely up to you. But, that\u2019s not to say that you can afford to be care-free about it. Ask yourself, am I practicing safe sex, getting tested regularly, and is my lifestyle making me happy? If you\u2019re satisfied, then the question of how many sexual partners doesn\u2019t really matter. Instead, focus on having good, safe sex and keeping aware of your STI status, whether that\u2019s in a monogamous relationship, with more than one partner, or with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sex is a personal thing.
