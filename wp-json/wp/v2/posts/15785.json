This has led to lots of speculation about whether or not Canada is entering a second wave.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We definitely need to continue exercising caution. Public health <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/health-infobase.canada.ca\/covid-19\/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">information<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows upticks in cities across the country in recent days. Ottawa <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/ottawa\/ottawa-covid19-second-wave-1.5729505\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirmed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it\u2019s in the midst of a second wave, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ontario-covid-september-18-update-1.5729286\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reinstated restrictions on social gatherings after reporting a huge jump in cases. This is a critical moment for stopping the virus from coming back in full force.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What exactly is a second wave?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curves and waves are both ways to describe the way COVID-19 case numbers look on a graph. At the outset of the pandemic, the curve on the graph spiked like a rising wave because there were so many new cases reported. Thanks to measures like quarantining and contact tracing, the curve flattened as cases went down. But COVID-19 didn\u2019t go away, and loosening social restrictions has pushed case numbers back up. Experts are worrying about a second spike of new infections.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How is the second wave different from the first wave of COVID-19?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some new challenges Canadians will face during a second wave of COVID-19. Here\u2019s what\u2019s changed since the first wave:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold weather.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The virus spreads more easily indoors than outdoors. As the cold weather drives us inside, indoor social gatherings of any size have a high potential for spreading COVID-19.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flu season is here<\/span>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a typical flu season, hospitals are used to an uptick in traffic from flu patients. Adding a rush of COVID-19 patients could spread hospital resources too thin. Plus, we\u2019re not sure how COVID-19 interacts with flu strains, so having patients with either virus in close quarters isn\u2019t ideal.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health is an ongoing concern.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/7092929\/coronavirus-mental-health-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">84%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people surveyed have declined in mental health since the start of COVID-19. As cold weather approaches, there will be fewer opportunities to socialize in a safe way. In combination with emotional challenges leftover from the first wave of COVID-19, this could leave people in need of extra mental health support.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How will Canadians know if the second wave is here?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each community, city, and province is facing different realities when it comes to COVID-19\u2019s second wave. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no specific number of cases that makes the second wave official. Public health leaders review the number of COVID-19 cases <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/world\/canada\/canada-coronavirus-cases.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in each area daily, and compare it to the area\u2019s previous totals, dating back to March. When a region has an surge that remains high over a number of days, it\u2019s a red flag. Not sure how your area is doing? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/world\/canada\/canada-coronavirus-cases.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check here.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What should we do to stay safe during the second wave?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret that being indoors all the time can be rough physically and mentally. The good news is that the longer we practice COVID-19 safety measures, the quicker COVID-19 goes away. To stop the momentum of the second wave, you can:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear a mask outside of the house.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socialize within your bubble.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash and sanitize your hands frequently.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay at home if you feel sick.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get tested for COVID-19, especially if you think you\u2019ve been exposed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socialize with elderly or immunosuppressed people at a safe distance, or virtually.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid unnecessary travel.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have the things you\u2019d need for two weeks of isolation ready at home in case someone in your household tests positive.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to get tested for COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you\u2019ve been exposed to COVID-19, or you\u2019re starting to have symptoms, public health guidelines suggest that you get <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/symptoms\/testing.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tested<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are three ways to test for coronavirus:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point of care tests. A medical professional will swab your nose or throat, and use a machine to determine if you test positive for COVID-19.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antibody tests. These are blood tests that show if you\u2019ve had COVID-19 in the past. Even if you have antibodies, you may not currently test positive for COVID-19. Antibody tests help Public Health track the spread of the virus through communities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molecular polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR tests). These are also taken by nose or throat swab, but results are analyzed in a lab. Turnaround time for these tests is usually 1-3 days.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re unsure, there\u2019s a self-assessment <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thrive.health\/health-canada-self-assessment-tool\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can help you gauge the likelihood that you have COVID-19. Here\u2019s a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/symptoms\/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of where you can get tested in each province.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s any silver lining to a second wave, it\u2019s that we have the power to stop it in its tracks. Communities across Canada were able to do it after the first wave, and with some diligence, it\u2019s possible to do it twice. And while you\u2019re looking out for friends and family, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s important to look after yourself too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re feeling sick, have questions about your health, or need a convenient prescription refill, talk to a doctor online. It only takes a couple of minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>COVID-19 numbers are rising now that the weather is cooling off.
