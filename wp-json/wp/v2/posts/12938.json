You&#8217;re lying awake at night, watching the minutes and hours tick by. The harder you try to fall asleep, the more futile it is. That&#8217;s the conundrum of sleep problems. And, it&#8217;s something many Canadians grapple with on a nightly basis.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep and mental health <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are intimately connected. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-importance-of-sleep-are-you-really-getting-enough\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adults should get 7-9 hours of sleep per night<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but studies show that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33% of Canadians over 35 fall short.<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep problems<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a stressful experience, and the irony is that stress makes it hard to get a good night\u2019s rest. This vicious cycle obscures the underlying issues that are causing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poor sleep habits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the first place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effects of sleep deprivation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50% of Canadian adults have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Over time, sleep disturbances lead to a state of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep deprivation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While much of the brain is a mystery<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we do know that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/lack-of-sleep-side-effects\/\">sleep deprivation\u2019s effects<\/a> on the brain<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can worsen sleep disorders.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Psychological effects of sleep deprivation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> usually reveal themselves after a month of insufficient rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are over 70 kinds of sleep disorders. You probably know of insomnia, which is a condition where you have a hard time falling or staying asleep. The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effects of insomnia<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can easily impact your quality of life. If this happens to you, you\u2019re not alone. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2005001\/article\/8707-eng.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study found<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that 3.3 million Canadians struggle with insomnia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obstructive sleep apnea causes breathing troubles and frequent waking. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3938242\/#:~:text=An%20estimated%205.4%20million%20Canadian,obstructive%20sleep%20apnea%20(OSA).\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.4 million Canadian adults have sleep apnea,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or are at high risk of developing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation causes emotional disturbances like feeling irritable, anxious, or grouchy. People who are sleep deprived often have trouble focusing during the day, struggle with remembering things, and feel tired at inconvenient times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation and mental health<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are so closely tied that psychiatrists and psychologists <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider insomnia an early warning sign of mental illness. For people living with bipolar disorder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/bipolar-disorder\/guide\/bipolar-disorder-and-sleep-problems#:~:text=For%20three%20out%20of%20four,some%20people%20with%20bipolar%20disorder.\">sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of mental challenges, the effects of sleep deprivation manifest in your body as well. Poor sleep causes low libido, weight gain, and can weaken your immune system. This makes you more susceptible to catching diseases like the cold or flu.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasons for sleep problems<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reasons for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep disturbances<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are wide-ranging, from too much screen time, to deep-rooted mental health challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several mental health problems that produce sleep disruption<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation and anxiety<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a common pair. People with short-term anxiety, and people with long-term anxiety disorders, often report trouble getting enough sleep.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experience of not being able to fall asleep can increase anxious feelings associated with bedtime. It\u2019s understandably stressful to have trouble sleeping, and that stress turns into more fuel for anxious thoughts. For people having difficulty breaking the cycle, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help build new routines and improve feelings around sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) makes it hard to sleep for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/newsletter_article\/sleep-and-mental-health\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25%-50%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of children who have it. Youngsters may have a tougher time understanding why they feel restless and irritable when they&#8217;re tired. Poor sleep and ADHD are so often reported together that, much like with anxiety, it can be hard to tell if sleep problems or ADHD came first.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does lifestyle impact sleep?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lifestyle habits contribute to sleep problems, too. Coffee drinkers might have trouble sleeping because caffeine is a stimulant. Tobacco, alcohol and other drugs can prevent you from sleeping at all, or prevent you from sleeping deeply.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stimuli like light from cell phones and television screens interrupt our ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. A bedtime routine that involves shutting off screens, mindful wind-down activities like meditation, and noise reduction, can help you naturally drift off to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The link between sleep and mental health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientists are still exploring the exact link between <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep issues<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and mental health. Some experts study <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leep psychology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exclusively. Their work involves helping patients manage their sleep disorders, and educating on sleep habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though we have more to learn, it&#8217;s clear that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep deprivation impacts a person\u2019s psychological<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> state. C<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hronic sleep disorders<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are more prevalent in people who have depression than in mentally healthy people. In Canada, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12.3% of sleep deprived adults<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0report having poor mental health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a person falls asleep, there are four stages they pass through. These are wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/newsletter_article\/sleep-and-mental-health#:~:text=The%20other%20sleep%20category%2C%20REM,emotional%20health%20%E2%80%94%20in%20complex%20ways\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are links<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between the duration of a person\u2019s REM sleep and their memory, ability to learn, and emotional wellbeing. Some research correlates <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">depression and insufficient REM sleep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get help<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health and proper sleep go hand in hand. Working with a professional can help uncover poor sleep habits, or stressful thoughts causing insomnia. You can contact our psychiatrists or psychologists to get started with better sleep, right from the comfort of your bed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sleep and mental health are intimately connected, but many Canadians don&#8217;t get enough shut-eye.
