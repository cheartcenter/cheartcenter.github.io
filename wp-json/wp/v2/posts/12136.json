While kids are at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/what-are-the-rules-for-kids-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\">lower risk of becoming seriously ill<\/a> if they catch COVID-19, there are some worrying symptoms popping up that every parent should look out for. Let\u2019s start with everyone\u2019s first big question.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why are you just hearing about new, serious symptoms?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 is a brand new virus. Six months ago, it wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar. That not only means that most people were unprepared for this new reality, it also means that scientists haven\u2019t had a lot of time to conduct studies on the virus. With something like the common cold, scientists have had decades to conduct systematic research on possible symptoms for every age group out there.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For COVID-19, while we&#8217;ve known about some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/cold-flu-allergies-or-covid-19-how-to-tell-the-difference\/\">symptoms<\/a> for quite some time, others we&#8217;re just discovering. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only have we had limited time for COVID-19 research, but kids also (thankfully) don\u2019t tend to get as sick as adults. It\u2019s been rare for doctors to be able to follow the progression of the illness in kids from beginning to end. All the evidence for the two new symptoms we\u2019re talking about here is purely anecdotal. Meaning, doctors have seen a notable increase in these types of cases, but there hasn\u2019t been enough research to prove how they\u2019re linked to COVID-19. That said, it would also be pretty strange if these conditions were popping up in isolation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is Kawasaki syndrome?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also called Kawasaki disease, this illness causes inflammation or swelling in blood vessels throughout the body. When found early, most children recover without any problems. However, if left untreated, it can damage a child\u2019s coronary arteries, which carry blood to the heart. Kawasaki syndrome isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s one of the leading causes of heart disease in kids today \u2014 but scientists haven\u2019t found an exact cause for it either.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the link between Kawasaki disease and COVID-19?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors are seeing an increase in Kawasaki-like symptoms. But since we haven\u2019t had time to study the cause or symptoms, we can\u2019t say for sure that this is Kawasaki syndrome. What we do know is that there\u2019s been an increase in the number of kids exhibiting Kawasaki-like symptoms. Lacking definition, you may also hear this phenomenon referred to as \u201cmultisystem inflammatory syndrome.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of this Kawasaki-like disease.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look out for these symptoms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdominal pain\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fever<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red eyes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rash on the hands and feet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are COVID toes?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the quirky name suggests, this one is new. Like COVID-19, which we all started off inappropriately calling \u201cthe coronavirus\u201d, we\u2019ll likely have a more scientific-sounding name for this condition soon. In the meantime, we\u2019re just calling it what we think it is \u2014 a COVID-19 related condition that affects your toe(s), or \u201cCOVID toe\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, there hasn\u2019t been enough time to conduct systematic research so we\u2019re not entirely sure what the cause is. But, doctors believe it\u2019s likely linked to small blood clots in the veins caused by COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What does COVID toe look like?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term COVID toes refers to blueish-red or purple bumps that hurt or feel warm when touched. The bumps look similar to frostbite, but we\u2019re thankfully getting out of the season for that. It\u2019s worth noting that while COVID toes appears most commonly in kids, it\u2019s also been seen in teens and young adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What to do if your child has these strange symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to get both conditions looked at by a doctor. That\u2019s especially true if your child has strange rashes or red eyes that could indicate an inflammatory illness like Kawasaki disease. The long-term health of your child\u2019s heart isn\u2019t something to put off until your regular doctor\u2019s office takes appointments again. Virtual doctor appointments are great for both these symptoms. Simply snap a picture and send it to the doctor or have a video consultation so the physician can do a visual inspection. They can then let you know if the symptoms warrant an in-person assessment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While kids are at lower risk of becoming seriously ill if
