This is in part due to women being more likely to eat better, drink less, and wear sunscreen \u2014 among other things. Aging is inevitable, but certain interventions can help you increase your longevity \u2014 or at least live better, if not longer. Here are the top five health tips for men as they age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Use it or lose it<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 30, muscle mass begins to decline. The less you exercise, the faster this muscle loss happens. This can lead to a whole host of problems \u2014 from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2804956\/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking,60%20%5B4%2C5%5D.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced mobility to disability<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The good news is that a suitable exercise program can help you stay mobile and independent longer as you age. It can also help to stave off osteoporosis, and even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alzheimers.org.uk\/about-dementia\/risk-factors-and-prevention\/physical-exercise#:~:text=Exercising%20in%20mid%2Dlife&amp;text=Combining%20the%20results%20of%2011,reduced%20by%2045%20per%20cent.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dementia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Adults between 18 and 64 need about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/csep.ca\/CMFiles\/Guidelines\/CSEP_PAGuidelines_0-65plus_en.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">150 minutes of exercise a week<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in bouts of 10 minutes or more. Don\u2019t worry about bench pressing, or running a marathon though \u2014 your exercise program should be attainable. Try an after dinner walk, ride your bike to work during the week, or lift small weights while you watch TV. You can\u2019t stave off aging, but regular exercise can help you do it more healthfully.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Reign in your drinking<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer pong isn\u2019t good for anyone, but as you get older, the effects of drinking alcohol become more pronounced. The volume of water in your body decreases as you age, so the alcohol you drink is less diluted in your body. This makes alcohol more difficult for your body to process, and therefore more toxic. While reducing your alcohol consumption is good, even a couple of daily drinks can lead to health issues. Two beers every evening might not seem like a lot, but the effects of alcohol are cumulative. Fatty liver disease, for example, can happen to drinkers who regularly consume only one to two drinks a day. If you\u2019re a man, you should be especially aware of your alcohol consumption as you age, since <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccsa.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/2019-04\/CCSA-Canadian-Drug-Summary-Alcohol-2017-en.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">men drink more than women<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on average. There\u2019s no need to give up alcohol entirely, but if you find that you drink daily, plan for at least a few alcohol-free days a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t forget the sunscreen<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pain of a sunburn fades, but its long-term effects add up. Besides contributing to wrinkles, having just five sunburns over the course of your life doubles your risk for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skincancer.org\/skin-cancer-information\/skin-cancer-facts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">melanoma<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Places like your ears, the top of your head, and the backs of your hands receive more sun, and are especially vulnerable. This is particularly true if you work or spend a lot of time outside. About <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/chronic-diseases\/cancer\/melanoma-skin-cancer.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in 42<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> men will develop melanoma over their lifetime. Men are also much more likely to die of it than women, perhaps because they\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/709430\/face-sunscreen-users-by-gender-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">significantly less likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to wear sunscreen. The good news is that skin cancer is preventable, and the earlier it\u2019s caught, the better your prognosis will be. So slather on the SPF and pay attention to any new or changing moles. If you notice one with asymmetrical or irregular borders, or if it&#8217;s multiple colours, very dark, has increased in size, or if it\u2019s elevated, see a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermatologist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as soon as possible. Early detection could save your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Make time to de-stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little bit of stress at the right time works in your favour. It can help motivate you, and even increase resilience \u2014 think about the stress of starting a new job, for example. Chronic stress, however, is another story. Your body isn\u2019t meant to be in a heightened state all the time, and constantly exposing yourself to stress has profound consequences. Over time, chronic stress is responsible for everything from weakening your immune system to suppressing your sex drive. And because it\u2019s associated with a number of diseases, most notably <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5137920\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">atherosclerosis and depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, chronic stress may even shorten your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s impossible to remove all stress from your life. Learning to manage it, however, allows your systems to de-escalate, and gives your body a chance to repair itself. There are a number of ways to do this \u2014 exercise, meditation, or a mindfulness practice. But really, whatever works to take the pressure off for you is beneficial.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Maintain your social relationships<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re an extrovert or an introvert, socializing is a key part of aging well. People with fulfilling interpersonal relationships are happier than those without them. Having a strong social network isn\u2019t just about mental health, however. There\u2019s an extensive body of research on the benefits of social connection, and it\u2019s clear that our physical health also depends on having strong social bonds. People with higher levels of social connectedness have <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/ccare.stanford.edu\/uncategorized\/connectedness-health-the-science-of-social-connection-infographic\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower levels of anxiety<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, higher self-esteem, and are better at regulating themselves emotionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s clear that social isolation goes hand-in-hand with declines in physical and mental health, including higher levels of depression \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic has made this painfully obvious. Health-wise, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/staying-healthy\/loneliness-has-same-risk-as-smoking-for-heart-disease\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loneliness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is up there with smoking and obesity, and isolation is actually a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/241\/4865\/540\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk factor for mortality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Counteract these effects by staying connected as you age. Keep up with your friendships, and make a point of joining a club, religious organization, or volunteering \u2014 whatever keeps you feeling more connected to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t control your own mortality, but your quality of life as you get older is up to you. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong social support can go a long way towards helping you feel younger as you get older.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Life expectancy for men is about four years less than it is for women.
