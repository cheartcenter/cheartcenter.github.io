Everyone knows that you shouldn\u2019t smoke, especially while pregnant. However, how exactly maternal smoking affects your unborn child isn\u2019t always as clear. After all, babies live in your womb, not your lungs. So, what are the risks of smoking while pregnant, and are there ways of making smoking less risky?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Risks to fetal health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of smoking while pregnant are wide-ranging, and not just while your baby is in utero. Smoking can affect your pregnancy by causing premature delivery, low birth weight, and even increasing chances of a miscarriage. It can also potentially cause lifetime issues for your child as well, from birth defects like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marchofdimes.org\/pregnancy\/smoking-during-pregnancy.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cleft palate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5260151\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ADHD (attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Additional health repercussions from smoking while pregnant can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (formerly known as Sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/tn7379\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abruptio placenta<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (when the placenta detaches from the uterus before it\u2019s supposed to).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placenta previa (when the placenta covers the birth canal).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 50% increased risk of stillbirth<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Are there safer ways to smoke while pregnant?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting smoking before pregnancy is ideal. That being said, just because you started your pregnancy as a smoker doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s too late. Quitting at any time during your pregnancy decreases the risks for your baby, and cutting back helps too. Beyond these options, however, there isn\u2019t a \u201csafer\u201d way to smoke during pregnancy. Mild or light cigarettes might seem like a better alternative to regular ones, but they\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/should-you-be-vaping-instead-of-smoking\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has also been heralded as a safer alternative to smoking, but we currently don\u2019t have any long-term research on its effects \u2014 especially when it comes to pregnant women. For starters, electronic cigarettes contain nicotine, which is harmful to a developing fetus. Even more worrisome, several reports have found that certain e-cigarettes or their nicotine fluid contain a range of highly toxic chemicals like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/news\/news-releases\/2018\/study-lead-and-other-toxic-metals-found-in-e-cigarette-vapors.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lead<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6178300\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formaldehyde<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and acetone. We know that maternal exposure to these materials can increase the risk of miscarriage and cause <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nceh\/lead\/prevention\/pregnant.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">developmental issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the unborn child.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t start up again after the baby is born<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting smoking while pregnant is a huge accomplishment. But, it\u2019s also important that you don\u2019t start again once your baby is born. Babies who are exposed to secondhand smoke \u2014 like through a parent\u2019s smoking \u2014 are more likely to have breathing problems, including asthma and bronchitis, as well as other health complications, like ear infections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking outside might seem like the best way to handle the secondhand smoke issue, but this still leaves your baby exposed to thirdhand smoke. Thirdhand smoke is the leftover residue from cigarettes that stays on your hands, clothing, or furniture. Cigarettes are made up of a whole slew of toxic chemicals. When these chemicals combine with particles in the air, they form new, cancer-causing particles called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\/health-issues\/conditions\/tobacco\/Pages\/How-Parents-Can-Prevent-Exposure-Thirdhand-Smoke.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nitrosamines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Babies pick these up just by touching contaminated surfaces \u2014 like clothing or the floor. Even if you open a window, use a fan and only smoke when your child isn\u2019t home, they can still be exposed to thirdhand smoke.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should I stop breastfeeding if I can\u2019t quit smoking?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While quitting smoking is ideal, you should still breastfeed even if you\u2019re smoking as the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks. Instead of stopping breastfeeding, smoke outside, away from your baby. Before nursing, make sure to wash your hands and change your clothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Smoking and maternal health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking isn\u2019t just bad for your baby. Women who smoke increase their risk of developing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lung.org\/quit-smoking\/smoking-facts\/impact-of-tobacco-use\/women-and-tobacco-use\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multitude of cancers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including lung and uterine cancer. Moreover, they\u2019re at increased risk of stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and osteoporosis. On average, smokers die <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/tobacco\/data_statistics\/fact_sheets\/health_effects\/tobacco_related_mortality\/index.htm#:~:text=Cigarette%20smoking%20causes%20premature%20death,years%20shorter%20than%20for%20nonsmokers.&amp;text=Quitting%20smoking%20before%20the%20age,related%20disease%20by%20about%2090%25.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 years sooner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than non-smokers. Even if you don&#8217;t plan on getting pregnant, quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your own health.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do I quit smoking?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New research suggests that it can take up to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/6\/e011045\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 attempts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at quitting before it sticks, so don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes you more than one try. Cigarettes are designed to be addictive, and the mental and physical effects of quitting can be uncomfortable. Even if you quit and it doesn\u2019t last, it\u2019s not a waste. Each time you quit, you learn about your smoking triggers, which can help you with your next attempt. You\u2019re also giving your body and baby a break from smoking for that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step towards quitting smoking is to make a plan. Pick a quitting date and empty your house of anything smoking-related, like lighters and ashtrays. Speak to your healthcare provider about using smoking-cessation aids, like nicotine gum, safely during pregnancy. For more help on how to quit smoking, check out the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/road-quitting-guide-becoming-non-smoker.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government of Canada\u2019s guide to becoming a non-smoker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And don\u2019t worry about the effects of nicotine withdrawal on your baby \u2014 it doesn\u2019t hurt them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been smoking for a while, cigarettes are likely part of your daily routine. Getting rid of the association between smoking and certain activities can be even harder than breaking the physical addiction. As hard as quitting smoking is though, it\u2019s worth it. Stopping smoking while you\u2019re pregnant or before decreases many health risks for both you and your baby. And it\u2019s never too late to quit smoking \u2014 with support, a plan, and the desire to do it, it is possible.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the world.
