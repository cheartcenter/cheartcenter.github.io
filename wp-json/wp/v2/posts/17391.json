You may have heard:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Vaccine\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines typically contain a part of a virus, bacteria, or disease-causing organism that\u2019s either dead or weakened. Vaccines introduce germs to your system in a controlled way so that your body can learn to identify and destroy them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Immunization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the process of making someone immune to a disease. People who get the COVID-19 vaccine are considered immunized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A COVID-19 vaccine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/politics\/vaccine-rollout-plan-phac-1.5833912\">was recently approved in Canada.<\/a> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This vaccine is based on groundbreaking messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, which directs cells in the body to make proteins to fight or prevent disease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/awareness-resources\/know-vaccine.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">150<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> different vaccines being considered for use in Canada, so it\u2019s likely that more than one vaccine will be approved. Each manufacturer has a limit to the number of doses they can produce, so choosing more than one supplier prevents long wait times. Although the vaccines may be different, they\u2019re all held to the same safety standards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some COVID-19 vaccines may contain a weakened or dead form of COVID-19 mixed with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information\/page-15-contents-immunizing-agents-available-use-canada.html\">other ingredients<\/a>, such as<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjuvants, which boost your immune response when you get a vaccine. They encourage your body to produce a higher number of antibodies, helping your immunity last longer. Without adjuvants, you\u2019d need to be injected with more of the virus to get the same level of response from your immune system. Aluminum salts is a common adjuvant example.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antibiotics, to prevent bacterial contamination during vaccine production.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Formaldehyde, in tiny amounts, to kill the active virus.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Egg or yeast proteins, glycerol serum, amino acids, or enzymes. These help stabilize the vaccine.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccinations have been used in Canada for over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/vaccination-children.html#how-vaccines-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> years. Once you\u2019re vaccinated, your body develops the antibodies needed to destroy COVID-19. Then if you\u2019re exposed in everyday life, your immune system can eliminate the COVID-19 virus before it makes you sick or spreads to others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/vaccination-children.html#how-vaccines-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines are safe.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Normally, getting vaccinated does far <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/q-a-detail\/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination?adgroupsurvey=%7Badgroupsurvey%7D&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAwrf-BRA9EiwAUWwKXtSqTYdYQ1LU4ji2hH7rhtCw65oSBWTB54VcnNQx4oSQHIpPsOW2ARoC3YgQAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less harm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your body than catching the illness you\u2019re protecting yourself against.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways that disease-causing agents in vaccines are treated so that they won\u2019t make you ill:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inactivation. This is when the germ is killed before it\u2019s used in the vaccine. That stops it from being able to multiply, but still triggers your immune system to produce antibodies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attenuation. Attenuated vaccines still contain live parts of the germ, but they\u2019re significantly weakened.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vaccines go through three phases of human trials:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phase one<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A small number of volunteers are vaccinated. Scientists watch for their immune response, and narrow down the right dosage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phase two<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A larger group of people who are an accurate demographic representation of the community receive the vaccine next. It\u2019s usually hundreds of people, and their immune response is monitored along with any disease outcomes. Some are given the vaccine while others are not, and comparisons between the groups can be made.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phase three<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thousands of volunteers are vaccinated, while other volunteers are given a placebo vaccine like in phase two. This helps researchers understand the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy compared to people who don\u2019t take it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These phases normally take around 10 years in Canada. Since the international medical community is focused on developing a COVID-19 vaccine, the process has moved much faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side-effects<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people do experience side-effects from getting vaccinated. They\u2019re normally mild and easy to recover from, lasting from a few hours to a few days. Common side effects include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soreness, swelling, and red, irritated skin near the site of the vaccine injection.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mild fever.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarely, people experience more serious side-effects from vaccinations, like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fever of 40\u00b0C or more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An itchy rash at the site of injection.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/vaccination-children\/safety-concerns-side-effects.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 people for every million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vaccinated experience anaphylaxis, which includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facial swelling<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sudden drop in blood pressure<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdominal pain<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty breathing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itchy rash<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sneezing, coughing, or vomiting<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I get the COVID-19 vaccine?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone in Canada will be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. Each province has its own plan for how to distribute vaccines once they&#8217;re approved by the federal government. As more information about vaccines becomes available, you&#8217;ll be able to find local resources that will inform you where you can receive the vaccine.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A COVID-19 vaccine has just been approved in Canada.
