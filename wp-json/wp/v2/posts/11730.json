Everyone is making adjustments, but no matter how big or little your kids are, keeping them inside 23 hours a day is challenging. If you\u2019re lucky enough to still be working, sharing the space is even more difficult. We\u2019ve compiled a list of tips to help you share your space while safeguarding your mental health through COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Build your routine<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t already, your first step should be to get your household on a schedule, or at least a routine. Wake up at the same time every day and try to go to sleep at the same time every night. If possible, go a step further and plan your days out a week in advance, determining which activities will happen when. If your children are old enough, include them in the planning. For younger children, consider making a visual schedule or activity calendar. Meals provide natural points of demarcation throughout the day, and you can work in activity blocks before and after them. Structure is comforting and soothing, and building a schedule gives you a sense of control in a world of unknowns. Routines can also help us <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep better<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and can even help kids <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10802-010-9447-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moderate their behaviour<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And don\u2019t forget to make physical activity and sunlight a part of your everyday routine \u2014 whether it\u2019s a trip to the backyard or a neighbourhood walk (while keeping at least two metres away from anyone else).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A place for everything and everything in its place<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you had a coworker who chopped onions in your shared cubicle every day you\u2019d lose it. So it\u2019s no wonder that working at the kitchen counter while your partner cooks is difficult. Even if they\u2019re just a few feet apart, designate different spaces for different activities. Have one space marked off for work, another for puzzles, and another for TV, for example. Environmental chaos makes it hard to stay focused, so keep each activity to its designated spot and make sure everyone cleans up one activity before beginning another.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lower your standards<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few articles have recently come out suggesting that now is a perfect time to learn a new language or take an online course. And while it might be for some people, for most of us that\u2019s not a realistic goal. Setting daily goals is a great way to help us feel like we\u2019ve accomplished something, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean learning C++. Setting small, attainable goals like doing a load of laundry, or clearing out a desk drawer is enough. And this applies to your kids\u2019 schooling too. You didn\u2019t choose a career in teaching (unless you did), so don\u2019t kill yourself trying to teach your kids French, chemistry, and music all in one day. You don\u2019t need the added stress and neither do they! School boards are in the process of rolling out programming so you can leave the pedagogy to the experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Limit your media consumption<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our current situation is unprecedented, and it can be hard to unplug from what\u2019s happening. But a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5125894\/is-reading-news-bad-for-you\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barrage of news<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fuels the idea that things are constantly getting worse, which only heightens anxiety levels. Pick a couple of reputable news sources (not social media) and limit your consumption to specific times of day (watching the morning and the evening news for example). While it\u2019s tempting, resist the urge to have the TV or radio on constantly in the background. Children of all ages, even toddlers, are smart and intuitive. Continuous exposure to stressful news stories impacts their mental health as well. If the silence is too much, try some upbeat music or a fun movie instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice physical distancing and social connection<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because we\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/diseases-conditions\/social-distancing.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">physical distancing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, doesn\u2019t mean we have to be socially distant. Technology has given us so many different options for communicating with our loved ones, and it\u2019s available for all ages. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage your parents to hold their weekly wine club \u2014 ahem, book club \u2014 by video conference, organize a teleconference playdate for your toddler, or give your teenagers the time they need to interact with their friends (virtually). And don\u2019t forget your own mental health needs either \u2014 humans are social creatures and we crave connection with others. We rely on those we love more than ever in times like these, and separately, together, we\u2019ll get through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 pandemic is going to be with us for another few months at least. While necessary, physical distancing and self-isolating measures are also incredibly stressful. We have the opportunity to make a real difference just by staying home, but we need to do that safely. So take care of your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and don\u2019t be afraid to reach out for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">therapeutic help<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Physical distancing is keeping us physically healthy, but it&#8217;s impacting our mental health.
