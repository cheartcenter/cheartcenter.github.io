A lot has changed in our lives, and it\u2019s all happened very quickly. Self-isolation doesn\u2019t help the matter either. Instead of interacting with friends and family, many Canadians are keeping their eyes glued to the non-stop stream of news headlines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this period, remember that your mental health is an important piece of your overall health. If you\u2019re feeling worried or helpless, there are steps you can take to restore a positive mindset. Self-isolation doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer alone. We\u2019ve put together some powerful tips for coping with stress and anxiety during COVID-19, so you can emerge stronger on the other side.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Understand your personal risk factors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy for your anxiety to spiral out of control when you\u2019re taking in new information all the time. And there&#8217;s a lot of mis-information out there when it comes to COVID-19. To combat this, only collect information from credible sources to get a clear, accurate sense of your personal health risk. Credible sources include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Health Organization<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Canada<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.gov.on.ca\/en\/common\/system\/services\/phu\/locations.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your local public health unit<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that the majority of Canadians are not at risk of developing serious health complications from COVID-19. Equipping yourself with information can help you feel more confident about how things will unfold.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Don\u2019t watch the news <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> much<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s definitely important to stay updated on the ongoing COVID-19 situation, checking in two dozen times a day won\u2019t help. Your mental health will be better served if you limit your consumption of news stories to once a day. You won\u2019t be missing out on any important information \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely that official health recommendations will change much within a day, affecting how you should manage your risk.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Accept that some anxiety and fear is normal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve seen before, and things like self-isolation and social distancing are very new experiences for virtually all Canadians. Don\u2019t judge yourself for feeling some worry or anxiety. This anxiety is actually important for inspiring you to take proper measures to protect yourself and others. Social distancing, frequent hand-washing, and staying isolated if you\u2019re sick are all essential for flattening the curve of new infections.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Try not to think about the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In difficult scenarios, we tend to think about the worst possible outcomes. Mental health experts call this \u201ccatastrophizing.\u201d At the same time, we underestimate our own abilities to overcome the situation. Remember, you\u2019re resilient! You\u2019ve no doubt displayed grit and skills in the past that have helped you overcome tough challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remind yourself of your support network \u2014 your friends, family, colleagues, and possibly a therapist. There are lots of people who care about you and your well-being. You aren\u2019t in this alone. In Canada we have great resources like hospitals, to public health teams, to tight-knit communities. Collectively, we are strong.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Find relaxation rituals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of your time at home to engage in activities you truly love doing. Partaking in a hobby that brings you joy will help you manage your stress levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try out activities that are well-known for being effective stress relievers such as yoga, meditation, reading, or listening to music. These outlets can mentally transport you to another time and place, letting you take a small vacation from anxieties around COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Keep up a healthy diet<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During stressful times, many people turn to \u201ccomfort foods\u201d. As it turns out, these foods aren\u2019t so comforting to your mental health. Instead, choose whole foods that are full of vitamins and nutrients. A diet rich in these foods is proven to bring about feelings of well-being. Keeping up a healthy diet can also help you get a good night\u2019s sleep, which is imperative for keeping your mood, energy levels, and mental health stable. Plus, healthy foods boost your immune system, your body\u2019s internal defense system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Avoid substance use<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like comfort food, the temptation to indulge in cigarettes, drugs, or alcohol is particularly strong when you\u2019re stressed out. The catch is, these substances only provide short-term stress relief. Your body quickly develops a tolerance, which creates the need to use more and more. Overuse of substances can lead to physical and mental health complications completely separate from COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to avoid smoking and drinking during COVID-19 since smoking weakens the respiratory system, and alcohol weakens your overall immune system. Look to healthy, constructive mental outlets instead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Keep a proper sleep schedule<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good sleep schedule can help you manage the current stress in your life, and give you better coping abilities to handle stress in the future. To get a proper night\u2019s sleep, follow these \u201csleep hygiene\u201d tips:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your bedroom cool, dark and quiet.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid performing any work tasks, such as answering emails, an hour before bedtime.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t exercise up to an hour before bedtime.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get daily exercise.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid consuming caffeine and alcohol late in the day.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Stay active<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical activity reduces stress while also improving your mood. Even though you\u2019re quarantining at home, you can still stay active. Search for cardio workout videos on YouTube, go out for a jog, do some yoga, or perform bodyweight exercises such as planks or pushups. Working out will help you maintain a feeling of normalcy while isolated at home, and help you appreciate your healthy body.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Talk to a therapist<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still struggling to cope with worry and anxiety, it\u2019s absolutely appropriate to reach out to a medical professional. Speaking to a doctor or therapist can help you process difficult emotions. If you&#8217;d rather avoid in-person therapy, you can partake in online therapy from the comfort of your own home, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no matter what province you\u2019re in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re new to therapy, our friends at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shiftcollab.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shift Collab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have a helpful guide to everything you need to know about starting therapy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yes.shiftcollab.com\/starting-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this period, it\u2019s important to remember that this pandemic won\u2019t last forever. Try not to think in permanent terms \u2014 rather than saying \u201cI\u2019m stuck inside,\u201d try saying \u201cI\u2019m stuck inside just <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or now.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re not in this alone. You can empower yourself to better mental health through consistently checking in with yourself, following these tips, and talking to a mental health professional. While this is an uncertain time, your mental health needn\u2019t take a toll. Stay connected to friends and family, and above all, be kind to yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s perfectly natural to be feeling stressed and anxious during the COVID-19 pandemic.
