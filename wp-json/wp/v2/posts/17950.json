People report feeling anxious about their health and money, and feeling lonely because of social distancing. While we wait for the pandemic to end, a mood-boosting routine helps greatly when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Laugh<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know it feels good to laugh. The therapeutic benefits of laughter are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27439375\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">well-documented<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, . Laughter has positive effects on our mental health and our immune systems. It decreases your production of stress hormones, like cortisol, epinephrine, and human growth hormone. The less stress hormones your body is producing, the more relaxed you feel.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for ways to laugh? Watch some funny cat videos, or a stand-up comedy special. Or, you could phone call a funny friend to shoot the breeze.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Exercise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise helps increase the production of serotonin in your body, leaving you feeling mentally lighter. Serotonin is a hormone that plays a major role in regulating your mood. It enhances your feelings of wellbeing and helps regulate your sleeping and eating patterns. Both of these play an important role in maintaining happy, stable moods.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a relaxing walk or do an at-home workout routine to get the benefits of a serotonin boost.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Deep breathing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever noticed the way you\u2019re breathing when you feel stressed out? Chances are your breaths are quick and shallow. It\u2019s common for people who are anxious to breathe this way. Short breaths are a signal to your body that it\u2019s time to panic. This can result in muscle tension, lightheadedness, and developing a rapid heartbeat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can ease all those physical reactions by practicing deep breathing from your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/uz2255\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diaphragm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Slow breaths tell your mind and body there\u2019s no danger, helping you relax.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Practice gratitude<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who express their gratitude are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/healthbeat\/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">often<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> happier than people who don\u2019t. Practicing gratitude can be done in different ways. You might choose to tell someone you appreciate something they did for you, or quietly reflect on all the good things in your life. Regularly showing gratitude has been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/greatergood.berkeley.edu\/pdfs\/GratitudePDFs\/2Wood-GratitudeWell-BeingReview.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to improved mood, healthier eating habits, and lower stress.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it feels like everything is going wrong, try writing a list of all the things you\u2019re grateful for. A reminder of positive things in your life can help shift your focus away from things that are stressful.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Get dressed up<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to stay in your pyjamas all day when you\u2019re working from home. However, getting dressed as if you were heading to the office is good for clearing your mind. It\u2019s called a boundary-crossing task, marking the end of your morning routine and the beginning of your focused workday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you have no meetings, try getting dressed in the morning. Rituals like brushing your hair or choosing an outfit that makes you feel good are small acts of self-care.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Head outdoors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting out into nature has lots of health benefits. A practice called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/5259602\/japanese-forest-bathing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forest bathing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reduces production of cortisol, a hormone your body produces in high amounts when you\u2019re stressed out. It\u2019s the simple practice of walking through the woods without any set destination. Try not to look at your phone while you explore. Distractions will prevent you from fully experiencing the calming effect of being outside. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next time you need a break, make a trip to a local forest trail. City dwellers can head to the nearest urban park to be among the trees.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Nap<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napping is a great way to hit the reset button on a stressful day. Benefits of napping include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relaxation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less fatigue<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved mood<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved emotional regulation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure napping won\u2019t prevent you from sleeping soundly at night, keep your naps under 30 minutes and avoid napping after 3pm.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan a 15 minute nap break into your workday for a week. It might just help you sleep off some stress.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Eat mood-boosting foods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It feels good to eat junk food in a stressful moment, but doing so inevitably leads to a crash. Foods like candy and chips are high in carbohydrates that spike your blood sugar. This feels like a temporary high in your mood. However, once the sugar rush is over, you might feel worse than before. That\u2019s because your blood sugar levels eventually crash, causing anxiety and irritability.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foods that help regulate your blood sugar are great for keeping your mood on an even keel. Dark chocolate, almonds, salmon, and avocado are all foods that can help you keep your blood sugar and emotions stable.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Get therapy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking to a therapist will truly help you feel better long-term, not just in the moment. Regular therapy sessions are a useful addition to any mental health routine. The more you explore the reasons you\u2019re feeling down, the more you\u2019ll discover about yourself. You\u2019ll gain healthy coping skills for processing the sources of your stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a little creativity, it\u2019s possible to beat the blues. Oftentimes we can effectively boost our own moods with simple but powerful techniques. Being compassionate towards ourselves and being mindful of our whole-body health is key.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re finding it tough to cope, our doctors can help. Get connected over your phone, tablet or computer any time you need support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>COVID-19 has impacted both our physical and mental health.
