Everyone wants life to return to normal, and employers are keen to see their staff back at the office. Being physically present with your co-workers gives a sense of community, and allows for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/miro.com\/blog\/resources\/guide-effective-remote-brainstorming\/why-online-brainstorming-may-fail\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improved brainstorming and productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As businesses reopen, employers need to transition staff back to the office extremely carefully. COVID-19 is a numbers game. If one person in an office is infected, it doesn\u2019t take much for them to spread it to many more people. That\u2019s one of the main concerns around COVID-19 \u2014 that it spreads so rapidly. All the hard work we\u2019ve collectively done over the past months to flatten the curve could be for naught.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, employees may feel uneasy about this transition. Having flexible options like working from home should be considered if possible. If you need to transition back to the office, follow these guidelines to create a well-rounded strategy, and keep up the positive progress against COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. <\/span>Stay in compliance<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to listen to official government regulations at the federal, provincial, and municipal level. Only bring your employees back after emergency orders have been lifted, and people are once again permitted to gather in groups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay a step ahead of new company policy requirements. Before bringing employees back, create policies around disease testing, hand washing, extended work from home arrangements, and what to do if an employee contracts COVID-19. What if an employee doesn\u2019t feel safe returning to work? What will be your policy on business or personal travel? Answer all these questions upfront, before the situation arises. Consult an employment lawyer to make sure the policies you\u2019re setting are fair and legally sound.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People might be feeling anxious, or having reservations about trusting your safety measures. HR teams may receive an influx of questions the first few days your office reopens, and they should be prepared to address them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Modify the office<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your office setup probably still reflects the days before coronavirus. Now, you\u2019ll have to make sure that your employees work stations are at least six feet apart. Some offices are even installing plexiglass dividers between desks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that your office is fully stocked with hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, hand soap, and face masks. Mandate that employees wear masks at all times they\u2019re in the office. Latex gloves are not recommended. They can actually increase your chance of infection since they act as another surface for germ particles to adhere to. And, gloves tend to give a false sense of security to the wearers. People might assume they don\u2019t have to wash their hands as often if they\u2019re wearing gloves, which is very much a myth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Take a staggered approach<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your office doesn\u2019t have enough square footage to safely accommodate your whole staff anymore, bring back employees in waves on a daily or weekly basis. Schedule the engineering team to come to the office Monday, marketing on Tuesday, finance on Wednesday, and so on. Try to avoid having employees share desks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s feasible for your organization, poll your staff on their comfort levels. Some teams might volunteer to stay home for a longer term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If certain teams are well-suited to working from home, let them continue doing that. For example, it might make no difference to your security team where they work from. Keeping up remote work is a good way to reduce headcount at the office, making physical distancing easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which teams should you bring back first? If you have teams that require access to in-office equipment then bring them back. Or, do an analysis of how successful each team\u2019s transition to working from home has been. Bring back the teams that have struggled the most first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies are debating whether it\u2019s reasonable to expect a full return to \u201cnormal\u201d operations, even in the distant future.\u00a0 Some teams might be suited to permanent remote work. You can use this pandemic as a clean slate to decide what working arrangements are really most effective for your organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Encourage personal hygiene<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hand washing is one of the strongest tools we have against COVID-19. So, require employees to wash their hands constantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they arrive at the office.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before and after eating.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After using the restroom.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After touching highly-trafficked surfaces like doorknobs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage use of hand sanitizer as well. Remember though, sanitizer is no substitute for proper handwashing. Handwashing gets rid of dirt and grime, and kills more germs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your employees will no doubt be happy to see each other, advise them not to tearfully hug. An elbow bump is safer, as is a simple wave or finger pistol.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Manage the transition<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has done a number on many people\u2019s mental health. It\u2019s been a big upheaval getting everyone to work from home. Now that people finally feel adjusted to the WFH lifestyle, they\u2019re being asked to go right back to the office, back to their commute, and back to wearing pants without drawstrings. So, be sensitive to what your employees are going through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees with health conditions or weakened immune systems might feel more anxious about returning to the office. Employees with kids will have to make new childcare plans, which could be complicated and costly. There will be added stress with everyone having to change their daily lives, with no guarantee things will work out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remind your employees about their health and wellness benefits, if applicable. Virtual care can help support your staff by letting them stay home while still getting the care they need. This also helps keep up physical distancing efforts, even after society begins reopening.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A change management strategy will help you anticipate what challenges your employees might have. Have an open two-way communication channel for your employees to disclose any challenges they\u2019re facing, or ask any questions. This will help turn this transition period into something that strengthens the company culture, rather than undermines it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Disinfect from top to bottom<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every night after your employees go home, have a cleaning service come in and thoroughly disinfect your office. Some busy offices are even implementing hourly cleaning of high-traffic areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to disinfect the office yourself, grab some latex gloves and a face mask, some bleach or disinfectant solution, and some disposable paper towels. Open the windows so the smell of cleaning product doesn\u2019t become overbearing. Wipe down non-porous surfaces, especially ones that see a lot of traffic like doorknobs, elevator buttons, fridge doors, and banisters. Make sure you don\u2019t spray your disinfectant, as that can further spread virus particles. Mop the floor with bleach and soapy water to finish the cleaning job.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to the office is likely an exciting prospect for you and your employees. We\u2019re all missing our work friendships, our familiar spaces, and the variety of working somewhere other than our living rooms. It\u2019s important to keep safety top of mind when managing the transition though. Err on the safe side: have teams work from home if they\u2019re able, and invest in safety measures. Your company and your employees will both be protected, and we\u2019ll be one step closer to truly getting back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As businesses reopen, employers need to transition staff to the office carefully.
