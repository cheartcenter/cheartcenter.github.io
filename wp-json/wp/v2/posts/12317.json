An estimated 85% of teenagers will deal with acne at some point. Even though acne is an extremely normal occurrence, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not annoying.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What exactly is acne? When your pores or hair follicles get blocked, bacteria builds up and you get either a pimple, a whitehead, a blackhead, or a cyst. This usually happens when your skin\u2019s oil glands are overactive, resulting in excess sebum. Sebum is a waxy substance made by your skin\u2019s glands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most teenagers don\u2019t like their acne. You\u2019ll find lots of websites and forums listing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teenage acne solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teenage acne natural remedies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and diet tips to help with breakouts. Lots of natural remedies can actually damage your skin and aggravate your acne, so it\u2019s best to avoid them. Instead, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a dermatologist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get a doctor\u2019s eye on your unique skin, so they can propose a solution that will actually work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few main reasons teenagers get acne, and we\u2019ve outlined them here. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Puberty<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good old puberty, here to make everything more complicated. During puberty your body produces more sex hormones called androgens. Androgens cause increased oil production in your skin. The result? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenage acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne doesn\u2019t just appear on people&#8217;s\u2019 faces. Some <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teenagers get acne on their back<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, neck, lower body \u2014 anywhere you have pores. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormonal acne in your teenage years<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can\u2019t be prevented, but it can be managed with an effective, gentle skincare routine. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Genetics<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s out of your control. If your parents had acne, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll develop it too. Luckily, a skincare routine does wonders to make your skin look happy and healthy, even if a few pimples are also present.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Scrubbing and picking<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having acne is a super frustrating experience for many teenagers. It\u2019s tempting to want to attack your acne with your fingers, or scrub it away for good. Hold up! Picking at your skin can seriously aggravate your acne. When you pick at a zit, you force the oil even further down the pore. And, you can easily leave yourself with dark coloured acne scars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scrubbing can also make your skin inflamed and sensitive. Facial scrubs can also cause micro tears in your skin, leaving it more susceptible to acne down the road. They also break down your skin\u2019s natural barrier, which is important for maintaining hydrated skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Premenstrual syndrome<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, hormones are the culprit of an annoying breakout. Girls often have more acne right around their time of the month. This is due to higher levels of the hormone progesterone. PMS pimples tend to be red, inflamed, and never develop a whitehead. The good news is that once your hormone levels go back to normal, these pimples should clear up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Makeup and hair products<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all want to look our best, but sometimes the very products we use backfire on us! Makeup products and brushes can put acne-causing bacteria, dead skin cells, and oil right onto your face. There\u2019s also a tendency to be harsh on our skin when we\u2019re applying and removing makeup frequently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hair products can also cause acne if they spread oil or residue on your skin. This type of acne tends to show up as small bumps. They\u2019re not very noticeable, but they can also be a head scratcher as to where they came from.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Being a teenager is plain stressful sometimes. What\u2019s more, stress can make acne worse by raising cortisol levels in your body. Cortisol is a hormone that contributes to your \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. Oil glands in your skin actually have cortisol receptors, and will produce more oil when there\u2019s increased presence of cortisol.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treatment for teenage acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not much help to know the causes of acne without also having a solution. The great news is that acne is largely treatable. A <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teenage acne skincare <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">routine should be simple, non-irritating, and avoid heavy moisturizers. Here are some ways you can combat your acne and get clearer skin. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wash your face twice daily with warm water and gentle soap.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use non comedogenic hair and makeup products. These are less likely to clog your pores.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exfoliate with acids such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, or azelaic acid.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a gentle facial moisturizer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t pick at your face!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See a dermatologist who can prescribe acne medication.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenage acne prevention<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, right? Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you\u2019re washing your face perfectly and you still get clusters of pimples. During puberty, your hormones and genetics are beyond your control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent acne before it arrives, one of the best things you can do is have a pre-established skincare routine. Many young people don\u2019t think they need to wash and moisturize their skin, but it always helps to start early.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating a healthy, well-rounded <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diet can help with teenage acne<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Your diet influences your hormone levels and overall health. Eat low-glycemic index foods like leafy vegetables and whole grains to keep your blood sugar from spiking. Consuming more omega-3 fatty acids will also help lower inflammation levels in your body. Good sources of omega-3 include walnuts, chia seeds, salmon, and sardines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s debate around whether supplements help with teenage acne. A general multi-vitamin is good for you if you\u2019re low on nutrients. But, taking an excess of certain vitamins or minerals won\u2019t translate into clear skin. Save your money, and just speak to a dermatologist for proven <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teenage acne tips<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At what age does teenage acne go away?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re dealing with acne as a young person, you might be marking your calendar for the day your teenage pimples are scheduled to disappear. Sorry to disappoint \u2014 there\u2019s no set age that teenagers lose their acne and gain clear skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that teenage tends to dissipate significantly around age 20. Some people enter their adult years with much less oily skin, and their skincare routine can simplify. Other people actually get adult acne, whether or not they\u2019ve experienced teenage acne. Your skin is completely individual, so there\u2019s no sure way of knowing what will happen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do teenage acne scars go away?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One big reason why you shouldn\u2019t pick at your skin is you can easily get acne scars. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenage cystic acne can also leave scars, as these types of pimples are usually quite deep and inflamed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne scars usually don\u2019t go away on their own. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have severe acne, or if your acne is negatively impacting your self-esteem, it can be helpful to see a dermatologist. A dermatologist may prescribe a topical medication like a retinoid, or an oral medication such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/medications\/accutane\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accutane<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They can also give you expert advice on what types of daily products to use, and how to care for your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having acne when you\u2019re a teenager is extremely normal, so don\u2019t feel alone if you have a couple pimples that are giving you grief. If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/dermatologists\/\">see a dermatologist<\/a>, you can have an appointment via your laptop, tablet, or smartphone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An estimated 85% of teenagers will deal with acne at some point.
