You have to pick up food, but in doing so you\u2019re exposing yourself to lots of other people in a confined space. Not the most compatible with your physical distancing efforts, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, everyone needs to eat. Here are some tips on how to make your food runs as safe and hygienic as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shop at off-peak hours<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery shopping is essential, but visiting a crowded grocery store negates your efforts to physical distance. Peak hours for business at grocery stores are 4pm-6pm on weekdays, and afternoons on weekends. Try to shop outside of these hours so you can maintain your distance from other shoppers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid touching surfaces<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face is a major way COVID-19 spreads. Grocery store surfaces are especially risky \u2014 there\u2019s no telling how many people touch them throughout the day. Try not to touch any surfaces when you\u2019re out grocery shopping. Either wear disposable gloves, or use a cloth or your shirt sleeve to pick up items. Make sure you avoid touching your face when outside your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask about senior\u2019s hours<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a senior citizen, take advantage of special senior&#8217;s shopping hours. Many grocery stores and pharmacies are offering designated time for seniors to shop before opening to the public.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bring disinfectant wipes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery carts and baskets are touched by multiple people throughout the day, so they\u2019re not exactly sanitary. Bring a lysol wipe to the grocery store to quickly disinfect your push cart, shopping basket, and handles on freezer doors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use delivery services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re sick, it\u2019s important you stay isolated at home. There are grocery shopping services such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instacart.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instacart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that offer same-day or scheduled delivery. You can order your ingredients for dinner, go back to bed, and receive the food at your doorstep in a few hours. Delivery services are super handy, and help you avoid spreading or catching COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We tip our hat to grocery store workers \u2014 they\u2019re making a great personal sacrifice so the rest of us can continue accessing food. You can navigate the grocery store by taking care to stay a safe distance from other shoppers, and being wary of potentially dirty surfaces. And, there are grocery delivery options if you can\u2019t leave the house.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of handy on-demand services, you can see a doctor in minutes without leaving your home. Signing up for an account is easy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grocery shopping has gotten awkward. Not the most compatible with your physical distancing efforts right?
