While initial symptoms can seem innocuous and nonspecific, the condition can be dangerous, and even deadly if left untreated. So read on to learn more about what happens when your thyroid works overtime.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is hyperthyroidism?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thyroid produces the\u00a0hormones T3 and T4 which regulate our metabolism, so it has effects throughout the body. H<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yperthyroidism is caused by an overacti<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ve thyroid, and can be triggered by a few different conditions, both genetic and situational. Graves\u2019 disease, which is an autoimmune condition, is the most common cause. It often runs in families \u2014 meaning there is a genetic basis, and it causes your body to release antibodies that overstimulate the thyroid. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include lumps or nodules in the thyroid gland that cause the thyroid to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (known as toxic nodular or multinodular goiter.)\u00a0inflammation of the thyroid. Inflammation of the thyroid (known as thyroiditis) is also a precursor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of overactive thyroid<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many miss the initial <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signs and symptoms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as they may be subtle in the beginning.

Although 25% of these cases resolve themselves over the child\u2019s lifetime, the majority do not. Children experience the same symptoms as adults, however, they may also exhibit accelerated growth because of the condition. In children, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3608005\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism medication<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that interferes with thyroid function is usually the first line of defence. As with adults, surgery and treatment with radioactive iodine are used, but typically come later as they result in lifelong hypothyroidism.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Potential side effects<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased appetite can also be a byproduct of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weight gain<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sometimes follows. Many, however, don\u2019t find that they gain weight unless they develop hypothyroidism\u00a0as a result of treating their hyperthyroid issue (more on that below). While the initial symptoms of hyperthyroidism may seem innocuous or even beneficial (who doesn\u2019t like unintentional weight loss?), it\u2019s crucial to treat the condition. Untreated, hyperthyroidism does have the potential to be fatal. Since the\u00a0heartbeat can be affected, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/heart-disease-overview\/hyperthyroidism-and-your-heart\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cardiac arrest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a potential risk for both men and women, and other complications such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4314789\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">osteoporosis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and increased risk of bone fractures can occur.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is there a hyperthyroidism test?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a doctor will take your medical history and ask about specific symptoms, a conclusive\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diagnosis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0is made through a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/features\/lab-work\/\">simple blood test<\/a>. This test measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. Low or non-existent <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">levels<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TSH<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because when thyroid hormone levels are high, that signals to your brain that your body should produce less thyroid hormones, which the brain attempts to make happen by decreasing TSH secretion. But your thyroid is doing its own thing \u2014 it&#8217;s not listening to the body&#8217;s TSH cues \u2014 instead of responding, it just keeps going. In cases of hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high, which is due to your brain signalling your thyroid it needs to produce more thyroid hormones to make up for the deficiency. Same thing goes though, your thyroid is ignoring this and refusing to get to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hyperthyroidism treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment for overactive thyroid depends on the severity and cause of your symptoms. In many cases, you&#8217;ll be referred to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/endocrinologist\/\">endocrinologist<\/a> to develop a suitable treatment plan \u2014 they specialize in treating hormone related conditions so they&#8217;re the go-tos for thyroid conditions. The plan they develop with you could range from taking prescription medications, to more invasive treatments. When medication alone isn\u2019t enough, doctors instead focus on knocking out the thyroid completely. They do this either by surgically removing the gland, or by giving patients<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/hw148148\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">radioactive iodine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Although that may sound extreme, the thyroid is actually the only part of the body that absorbs the iodine. This destroys the thyroid but doesn&#8217;t damage the rest of the body. Unfortunately both the iodine and surgery leave the patient without an active thyroid gland \u2014\u00a0which results in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-weird-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism-you-might-be-missing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hypothyroidism<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This means they then have to take synthetic thyroid hormones for the rest of their life. So whether you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll end up on the same prescription medicine once all is said and done. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a diet for overactive thyroid?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thyroid requires iodine to function, so consuming too many foods or supplements containing it can cause hyperthyroidism\u00a0as well. In some cases, your doctor might suggest eating according to a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyperthyroidism diet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fish, seaweed and dairy products are all big sources of iodine, but speak to your doctor for a specific list of what to eat if they recommend a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diet<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overactive thyroid<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thyroid gland is crucial to the overall functioning of our entire body, and when it overproduces T3 and T4, many of our bodily processes speed up. When this happens, we need medical intervention to help our bodies get back on track. If you suspect that you have an overactive thyroid, our doctors are here to help.
