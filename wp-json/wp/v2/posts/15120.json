Learning how to soothe your baby is part of the parenting curve, but <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colic<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can\u2019t be soothed. While we know that colic isn\u2019t caused by bad parenting, it often makes new parents feel inadequate in their new role and it\u2019s correlated with higher rates of postpartum depression and marital dysfunction. The good news is that babies with colic do grow out of it. The bad news is that it can take a while. Here\u2019s how to cope with a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colicky baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is colic?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All babies cry, but <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colic<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cry longer than other babies, and seemingly for no reason. Colic is defined using the so-called \u201crule of threes.\u201d This means that a baby meets the criteria for colic once they\u2019ve hit three hours of crying a day, for at least three days a week, over a period of three weeks and are gaining weight and growing normally. Many parents report that their child\u2019s periods of crying tend to happen in the afternoon and evening, but they can take place at any time of the day or night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of theories about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what causes colic in babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but we don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s behind it. The numbers on colic aren\u2019t clear either \u2014 statistics show that somewhere between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutkidshealth.ca\/article?contentid=295&amp;language=english\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5% and 25%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of babies have it at some point. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colic<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often draw their knees up into their bodies, arch their bodies and tense their muscles while they cry, which can make it look like they\u2019re in pain. Despite this, most doctors agree (and the research backs them up) that colic isn&#8217;t caused by pain \u2014 gastrointestinal or otherwise. New research suggests that colic might actually just be a normal part of infant development. In short, babies cry, and some babies cry more than others, especially between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/colic_and_crying\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three and eight weeks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Colic in breastfed vs. formula-fed babies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rates of colic aren\u2019t different in formula-fed vs. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfed babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colic symptoms in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> both are the same. Sometimes, however, breastfed babies can be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadianbreastfeedingfoundation.org\/basics\/colic.shtml#:~:text=A%20baby%20who%20gets%20too,or%20struggle%20at%20the%20breast.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">misdiagnosed with colic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when they\u2019re actually having trouble latching on to the breast properly instead. An improper latch stops them from draining the breast fully. This means they get less of the richer and fattier hind milk (and end up hungrier). This can also cause an overactive \u201cletdown\u201d in one or both breasts, making the milk spray out forcefully. This can be uncomfortable for the baby, causing them to choke and pull off the breast. If your baby cries frequently and you feel like they aren\u2019t latching properly or aren\u2019t draining the breast fully at every nursing, it\u2019s worth speaking with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/lactation-specialist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lactation consultant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But breastfeeding is no more likely to cause colic than feeding your child formula.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby colic remedies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it seems like it will never end when you\u2019re in the thick of it, most babies grow out of colic by three or four months, without any lasting effects. Time is the only proven cure for colic. Certain techniques may help but figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to soothe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colicky baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depends on your child, and there\u2019s no specific recipe for success. Some parents swear that baby wearing lessens the duration and intensity of their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colic<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Others find that reducing environmental stimuli can help, as can rocking, shushing, singing softly or bouncing your baby. Playing soft, soothing music or even running a fan or a vacuum cleaner in another room can create a soothing background noise. A warm bath might also be helpful \u2014 especially if you get into the tub with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some parents find that their colicky baby cries all day, but sleeps easily and relatively uninterruptedly at night. Others have significantly more trouble figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to make<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">colicky baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fall <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asleep<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Walking the child around the block in the stroller or taking them for a spin in the car can help. Others swear that placing the child\u2019s car seat on top of the dryer is the secret to sleep success. Whatever your go-to move, always make sure to follow <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/health-promotion\/childhood-adolescence\/stages-childhood\/infancy-birth-two-years\/safe-sleep\/safe-sleep-your-baby-brochure.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safe sleep guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to reduce your child\u2019s risk of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/causes-of-sids\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIDS<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What doesn\u2019t work for colic<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many nursing mothers go on elimination diets, trying to figure out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what foods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">causing colic in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breastfed babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli may cause gas for nursing babies, gas doesn\u2019t cause colic. Dairy is often blamed for colic as well, but children who have dairy allergies or intolerances usually also have loose stool and other signs. Other remedies such as gripe water and ovol are marketed as helping to reduce both gas and colic, but none of them are backed up by evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Baby colic and maternal mental health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s growing recognition of just how serious <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/the-overlooked-aspects-of-postpartum-depression\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpartum depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (PPD) and anxiety can be \u2014 after all, they affect almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/daily-quotidien\/190624\/dq190624b-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in four<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadian mothers. And having a baby with colic <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2082735\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">significantly increases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the risk that a new mother will develop PPD. Even if they don\u2019t meet the criteria for PPD, parents of colicky children report higher levels of stress, anxiety and lower levels of parental self-esteem. Mothers with a colicky baby are also more likely to stop breastfeeding earlier and experience marital problems and social isolation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colic is no joke. Having a baby who won\u2019t stop crying is extremely distressing and enlisting the support of friends and family is crucial to get through it. You need to be able to take regular breaks from your child, even if it\u2019s just to walk around the block. Unfortunately, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/child-maltreatment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher rates of child abuse<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are seen in children with persistent crying. If you find that your baby\u2019s crying is more than you can handle, put them down in a safe place like their crib and take a 15 minute break. Crying won\u2019t damage them, and it may even help them learn to self-soothe. Parenting a newborn is incredibly challenging, and parenting a newborn with colic is exponentially more difficult. The most important thing you can do as a parent of a colicky child is to get support for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a baby with colic is one of the most difficult things you can go through.
