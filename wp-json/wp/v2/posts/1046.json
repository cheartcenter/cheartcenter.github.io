Hay fever, medically known as allergic rhinitis, is a common allergy in the spring time. The typical symptoms include\u00a0red and watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and &#8211; saving the best for last &#8211; itchy or sore throat!<\/p>\n<p>Aside from pollen in the spring time, the typical culprits for triggering allergies include\u00a0outdoor molds, dust mites, animal dander, indoor molds produced by items such as old books, indoor plants, and damp areas.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that seasonal allergies should never cause significant difficulty breathing. If you feel this way, this is a sign you may be suffering from something more severe like asthma, which requires thorough assessment by a doctor.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to help reduce your allergies:<\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your windows at night to prevent pollen, dust, and mold from entering your home\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a shower, wash your hair, and change your clothing after a day outdoors &#8211; pollens can attach to your hair and clothes, and transfer to your sheets and linens\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid cutting the grass since you can release pollens and molds into the air (if you must, wear a dust mask)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid hanging your sheets and clothing outdoors\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your windows up while driving (not fun, we know!)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regularly change your filters in air conditioners, heaters, and vacuums\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove carpets from rooms\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Since seasonal allergies are not deemed severe enough by many to justify a trip to the hospital or clinic, most sufferers feel reluctant to seek proper treatment. However, if your allergies aren\u2019t controllable with the above tips and over the counter treatment, it\u2019s a sign you should consult with a doctor. You may be able to\u00a0receive a prescription for allergy relief that will allow you to spend time outdoors more comfortably.<\/p>\n<p>One of the treatments your doctor may prescribe is a medication called Singulair (montelukast). This is a tablet that acts to block the effects of\u00a0<em>leukotrienes,<\/em>\u00a0a substance produced by your body in response to allergic triggers. This medication usually gives significant relief within one day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re all excited for the warmer weather, but enjoying the outdoors can be difficult if you suffer from seasonal allergies.
