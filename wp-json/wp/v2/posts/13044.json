How to improve communications with your team"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though most people are working from home, meetings still have to happen. The solution? Virtual meetings held over video chat platforms are the daily reality for many workers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans are social creatures, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a world in which we don\u2019t meet and share ideas in person. Face-to-face conversation also lends itself to spontaneously forging business connections, and discussing new opportunities on the fly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of virtual meetings<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are upsides to virtual meetings that have proved to be silver lining to gatherings during the pandemic era. For one, conferences and webinars can gain an international audience, and often greater overall turnout than could be expected in person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussions held over an online format are often improved as well. If one panelist is hogging the mic, the panel moderator could send them an e-note to let others have a chance to speak. \u201cNon-question questions,\u201d that are more akin to a rant or monologue, can also be avoided. With virtual conferences, panelists can give their attention to the more earnest, succinct questions proposed in a live chat bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your company may be having more regular scrums and department meetings than international conferences, the same principles still apply. A virtual setting is more easily controlled and moderated than an in person setting. And, the carbon footprint attached to virtual meetings is much lower. That means your employees spend less time commuting, and more time productive with work or tending to their families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual meetings are less onerous logistically and budgetarily speaking as well. There\u2019s no need to rent hotel rooms for board member attendees, or coordinate refreshments. These expenses were previously thought to be the cost of doing business. Now, their actual value can be weighed going forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Downsides of virtual meetings<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no upside without a downside, and virtual meetings have plenty. Some workers are experiencing what\u2019s informally known as \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/worklife\/article\/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom fatigue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d Video calls require more focus from meeting attendants to hear every word, and pick up on non-verbal cues that would come naturally in person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also technological difficulties that could strike anyone, even with the best of wifi. What\u2019s worse, when your video screen lags, you\u2019re personally judged for it. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1071581914000287\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A German study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that when peoples\u2019 screens delay by just 1.2 seconds, they\u2019re perceived as less friendly and focussed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people harbour stress over the pandemic, and video calls are a grim reminder of what they\u2019ve lost. Every time they log on to that familiar grid screen, there\u2019s a sense that things are profoundly not normal right now. And meeting everyone \u2014 friends, family, dates, colleagues \u2014 in the same video hangout space breaks down boundaries. Imagine meeting your entire peer group at the same cafe. Certain relationships are very contextual depending on their venues, and video calling removes that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video calling is also taxing on your brain. Interacting with many faces on many panels at once leads to split attention, and a mental multi-tasking. With multi-tasking, many jobs are attempted, but none are completed to satisfaction. It\u2019s the same with video calling. Your brain is exhausted afterwards, but you may not have felt as engaged or productive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to set up optimal virtual meetings<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to setting up successful virtual meetings is structure and planning. Try to streamline your virtual meetings. That way, everyone will know what to expect, and will be able to contribute meaningfully.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Set an agenda<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any meeting, consider \u201cShould this be a meeting, a phone call, or an email?\u201d Avoid setting unnecessary meetings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For meetings that are deemed necessary, put together an agenda beforehand, and share that agenda with all meeting invitees. During the meeting, try to stick to the agenda. Avoiding segue will make better use of everyone\u2019s time. If there are further conversations that need to happen between a smaller group, set up that meeting for a later date. What\u2019s discussed in a virtual meeting should be relevant for all participants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Share documents beforehand<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If anyone will be sharing documents during the meeting, attach them to the meeting invite so they can be reviewed beforehand. Then, participants won\u2019t be spending meeting time familiarizing themselves with the topic at hand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share the documents again during the meeting, in case some participants haven\u2019t had the chance to read through them yet. The presenter should verbally explain the contents of the documents if any meeting members have accessibility requirements, such as being blind or partially sighted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Assign a moderator<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video calls can get awkward when everyone speaks at the same time, falls silent, then speaks at the same time again. In regular meetings it\u2019s possible to have aside conversations. Over video, it only adds to the cacophony.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The moderator will quiet the chaos and let everyone have their turn to speak. The moderator should introduce the meeting members, announce the topic and agenda, give the opening remarks, and allow regular breaks for other participants to contribute.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a larger meeting or a webinar, the moderator can also take questions from the audience, or tell certain panelist speakers to simmer down and let other speakers have a turn.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The moderator will also have duties like informing meeting participants if sensitive topics will be discussed, letting them know recording will take place, and asking about accessibility requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Give people time to speak<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The squeaky wheel gets all the grease, and the loudest meeting member can sometimes drown out other peoples\u2019 voices. It\u2019s the moderator\u2019s responsibility to ensure everyone has the opportunity to contribute their thoughts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants can also use the raised hand emoji to indicate they\u2019d like to speak, or post a question in the video\u2019s chat box.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Think about accessibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers should always be thinking about their employees\u2019 accessibility requirements, and even more so during COVID-19. For example, someone who is blind or partially sighted will need things verbally described. Participants who are deaf or hard of hearing will need closed captions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no one\u2019s sure if virtual meetings are the new, permanent reality, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll be meeting over video calls for the foreseeable future. Many companies have announced they won\u2019t be opening their offices until 2021, and some have instituted a permanent work from home policy. If we\u2019re to continue working and connecting virtually, we have to become fluent with these mediums so that we\u2019re managing our mental energy, and using our time productively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic has added a load of mental stress to employees who worry about their health, families, job security, and future of their communities. As an employer, it\u2019s helpful to provide mental health resources during this tough time. Virtual therapy is a convenient, effective option.
