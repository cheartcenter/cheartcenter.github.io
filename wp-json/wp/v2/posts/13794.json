Feeling tired once in a while is part of life. But, there are lots of Canadians who feel tired way more than they should.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3033503\/canada-third-most-sleep-deprived-country-study\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada is the third most sleep-deprived country<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/2846614\/study-finds-one-in-three-canadian-men-are-sleep-deprived\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One in three Canadian men<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t get the sleep they need. In fact, a third of Canadians surveyed for one report said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/publications\/healthy-living\/canadian-adults-getting-enough-sleep-infographic.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they had difficulty staying awake during daylight hours.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even people who do get a full eight hours of sleep don\u2019t always feel energetic during the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel tired all the time, it can usually be traced back to one of three things. Persistent fatigue is linked to mental illness, underlying physiological issues, or lifestyle choices. Here are ten possibilities for why you\u2019re feeling fatigued, and tips to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Diet<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food is fuel. Junk foods that are high in sugar, while they provide a short-term energy boost, really slow you down. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/regeneratemedicalconcierge.com\/tired-after-eating-sugar-during-the-holidays\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s because they cause a spike in your blood sugar.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When that happens, your body produces insulin to bring your blood sugar down to normal. The sudden dip in your blood sugars leaves you feeling sluggish. Eating nutritious foods like vegetables and healthy fats can leave you feeling more energetic throughout the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Stress<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress causes your body to produce a hormone called cortisol that puts your system in fight or flight mode. When stressful thoughts put your body on<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3998365\/cant-fall-asleep-it-might-be-stress\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> high alert, it can be hard to fall asleep and stay asleep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Talk to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\">mental health professional<\/a> if sleeplessness from stress is making you tired in the daytime.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Lack of exercise<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you don\u2019t get enough physical activity, it can actually make you even more tired than when you\u2019re active. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise gets your blood pumping, which helps move oxygen and nutrients around your system.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This makes you more energetic and alert. When you\u2019re sedentary, your body <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/positivepsychologynews.com\/news\/marie-josee-salvas\/2010062411993#:~:text=Sedentary%20people%20therefore%20tend%20to,higher%20heart%20rates%20come%20fatigue.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn\u2019t get the oxygen it needs to convert your food into fuel.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That can leave you feeling less than your best.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Sleep disorders<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, it\u2019s tough to have a productive day. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/uh1001\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep disorders like insomnia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can rob your energy if they\u2019re left untreated. Long-term effects of sleep disorders include changes in mood and trouble focusing on daily tasks. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/sleep-therapist\/\">A sleep therapist<\/a> can help you get to the root cause of your trouble sleeping, and ultimately improve your waking hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Anemia<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re anemic, your body has trouble supplying its tissue with enough oxygen. Your body needs oxygen to turn nutrients to fuel. That\u2019s why anemics experience feelings of weakness and tiredness throughout the day. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/anemia\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20351360#:~:text=Anemia%20is%20a%20condition%20in,range%20from%20mild%20to%20severe.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several different types of anemia.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some are caused by a lack of minerals like iron, and others are hereditary. A doctor can help you assess your risk and recommend the best treatments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Diabetes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with diabetes experience fluctuations in their blood sugar levels. When that happens often enough, the rollercoaster of high and low blood sugar can cause fatigue. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/323398\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rest won\u2019t fix this kind of tiredness.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019re at risk or living with diabetes, speak to a doctor or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/endocrinologist\/\">endocrinologist<\/a> to find the right diet and medicine for you. It could be just what you need to balance out your system and get your energy back.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Alcohol<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol is a sedative. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/mind-and-mood\/alcohol-and-fatigue#:~:text=What's%20more%2C%20alcohol%20may%20increase,you%20feel%20drowsy%20or%20lethargic.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means it makes you drowsy, and if you\u2019re already tired, it will add to your fatigue.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can also compromise the quality of your sleep. Once you drift off, alcohol <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/mind-and-mood\/alcohol-and-fatigue#:~:text=What's%20more%2C%20alcohol%20may%20increase,you%20feel%20drowsy%20or%20lethargic.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can make it harder for you to sleep without waking up during the night.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>8. Caffeine<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/healthycanadians.gc.ca\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2017\/63362a-eng.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy adults should only drink one cup of coffee per day.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caffeine provides a nice boost for a little while, but just like anything else, what goes up must come down! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After-effects of too much caffeine include tiredness and trouble focusing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Being mindful of your caffeine intake could improve your daytime stamina. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>9. Depression<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fatigue is a symptom of depression.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019re feeling tired and finding it hard to enjoy things that usually make you happy, talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you resolve trauma and negative thought patterns that are sapping your zest for life.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>10. Sleep apnea<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep apnea is more than just snoring. The condition causes your throat muscles to become too relaxed, which obstructs proper breathing. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/national-sleep-apnea-health-risks-1.4925252\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can happen hundreds of times per night<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, causing extremely poor sleep quality that can seriously reduce your energy during the day. Sleep tests can reveal the root cause of your sleep apnea.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re feeling fatigued during the day, you may have to do some exploring to find the root cause. From diet to depression, there are lots of circumstances that result in feeling tired all the time. Whether you need sleep therapy or a naturopath, there&#8217;s a healthcare provider to help you out. We hope that helps you rest a little easier!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Millions of Canadians experience daily fatigue that makes it hard to be fully present, even for fun activities.
