On average, Canadian men live <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4145701\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four years less<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than Canadian women do. They\u2019re also more likely to die from diabetes, heart disease and liver disease. So let\u2019s take a deeper dive to find out what\u2019s going on with men&#8217;s health in Canada, and discuss some simple <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health tips for men<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Health facts for Canadian men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">health issues, men<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just aren\u2019t taking care of themselves as well as women do. While many Canadians <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/t1\/tbl1\/en\/tv.action?pid=1310009604\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report fairly high levels of stress<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, men are less likely than women to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviours to counteract it. In fact, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than half<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian men aren&#8217;t getting enough sleep, aren&#8217;t exercising enough and aren&#8217;t eating as healthy as they should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It likely doesn\u2019t come as a shock that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/news\/2018\/06\/mens-health-week.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian men aren\u2019t getting the six to nine hours of sleep a night that they need. Lack of sleep <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/lack-of-sleep-side-effects\/\">increases our risk of both obesity and diabetes<\/a>, so do yourself a favour and make sleep a priority. And most of us also need to work some\u00a0more exercise into our day \u2014 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">59 percent<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Canadian men say they\u2019re not reaching the 150-minute weekly minimum our bodies need to stay healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Alcohol and health risks in Canadian men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep and exercise aren\u2019t the only areas of improvement, though. Even though Canadian <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/politics\/alcohol-drinking-women-1.4890268\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">women are drinking more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than ever, they still have a long way to go before they catch up to men. A <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/healthycanadians.gc.ca\/publications\/department-ministere\/state-public-health-alcohol-2015-etat-sante-publique-alcool\/alt\/state-phac-alcohol-2015-etat-aspc-alcool-eng.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report on alcohol consumption<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Canada suggests that while one in five women admits to risky drinking at least once a month, that number jumps to one in three when we look at men. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like cigarettes, alcohol is carcinogenic. Heavy drinking increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including cancers of the liver, oesophagus and larynx. It can also lead to cirrhosis of the liver. No one is expecting men give up drinking completely \u2014 one to two drinks a day may even have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/healthy-drinks\/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation\/alcohol-full-story\/#possible_health_benefits\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preventative effect<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in terms of heart disease. But like most things in life, moderation is key.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Healthy eating for men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic or not, eating five to 10 servings of fruit and vegetables a day <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/organic-foods-and-cancer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lowers your risk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of developing both heart disease and certain types of cancer. Unfortunately, many Canadian men aren\u2019t getting the minimum number of servings. While almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-625-x\/2019001\/article\/00004-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of women report eating five or more servings, only 22% of men report the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy eating is important for you as an individual. For those of us who are parents though, it is part of the job. Making good dietary choices is crucial for helping your family to stay healthy, since your children are watching you. Being exposed to a healthy diet in childhood will lead to your kids making healthier choices for themselves in the long-term. So make sure your whole family is getting their 5-10 a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The protective benefits of strong social bonds<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying healthy means paying attention to more than just your physical body \u2014 it involves your emotional and mental health, too. According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, by the time Canadians turn 40, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.camh.ca\/en\/driving-change\/the-crisis-is-real\/mental-health-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">half of us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will have had or will be experiencing a mental illness or addiction. Dealing with these difficult issues requires support \u2014 from family, friends and community. Stereotypical ideals of the \u201cstrong, silent\u201d man, however, can make men feel like they shouldn\u2019t talk about their feelings. So they can be left isolated, with no one to talk to about what is troubling them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narrow and outdated ideas around what men \u201cshould do\u201d can prevent men from developing intimate relationships where they feel free to\u00a0share their feelings and experiences. Strong social support can be a protective factor when it comes to suicide prevention, and indeed\u00a0the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-624-x\/2012001\/article\/11696-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suicide rate for Canadian men<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is three times higher than for women, with those aged 40-59 most likely to die from it. Divorced men are almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/54\/4\/254\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">twice as likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to commit suicide as married men.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be alert to the signs and symptoms of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/Depression-treatment\">depression<\/a> and other mental health issues. And take stock of your support system \u2014 meaningful relationships and supports help prevent a host of issues. But if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing with friends, you can always speak to your doctor or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychotherapist-counselling\/\">therapist<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Healthy lifestyles mean healthier living for men<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do Canadian women typically live longer than men, men also have fewer years of good health. The lifestyle choices we make as young people follow us throughout our lives. Smoking, heavy drinking and inactivity will often cause health trouble later on. Our statistics show that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for men, healthier living <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needs to become more of a priority. You will thank yourself for it later, since simple lifestyle changes can help to prevent a host of issues.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have a healthcare gender gap \u2014 how you can help yourself, or the men in your life. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":12670,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[31],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v16.4 (Yoast SEO v16.4) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What&#039;s happening with men&#039;s health in Canada? | Maple<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Canadian men can expect to live four fewer years than Canadian women and have fewer healthy years.
