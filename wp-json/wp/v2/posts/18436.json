While most vaccines take years to formulate and test, 2020 saw two COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in Canada.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that a COVID-19 vaccination campaign is underway across the country, you may be wondering when Canada\u2019s workforce will be able to resume office work. Here are some important elements to consider as your organization prepares for a return to the office.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerging from COVID-19 \u2014 the year ahead<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the moment, two COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by Health Canada and are now ready for distribution. They come from the pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer. Both vaccines are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statnews.com\/2021\/02\/02\/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 90% effective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at immunizing against COVID-19. This means that if 100 people were to receive a vaccine, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1930285\/what-does-90-percent-effective-mean-for-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fewer than 10 people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would contract COVID-19. As for how long immunity lasts, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/radio\/quirks\/nov-14-covid-vaccine-immune-durability-wallabies-in-the-uk-ancient-female-hunters-and-more-1.5799632\/covid-vaccines-are-on-the-horizon-but-how-long-might-protection-last-1.5799649\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no one knows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> quite yet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company based in the United Kingdom, has also developed a vaccine that\u2019s up to 90% effective. We\u2019re still awaiting its possible approval and rollout in Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the arrival of a vaccine signals a turn in the fight against COVID-19, we still have a long way to go before we can reap its benefits as a society. Producing vaccines for millions of Canadians and coordinating delivery and vaccinations will require Herculean, months-long efforts. Moreover, both COVID-19 vaccines require two shots taken a few weeks apart, which adds significant logistical hurdles. The first shot introduces the body to the COVID-19 virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response even more. After vaccination, it typically takes the body a few weeks to reach peak immunity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both vaccines also require intense refrigeration. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine must be chilled at minus <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/11\/17\/935563377\/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70 degrees celsius<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while Moderna\u2019s vaccine must be stored at minus 20 degrees celsius. AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine has a notable advantage \u2014 it can be kept in regular refrigerated conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines elicit a fairly broad immune response, so <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/media-resources\/science-in-5\/episode-20---covid-19---variants-vaccines?gclid=CjwKCAiAmrOBBhA0EiwArn3mfAEHPT51GdNHvgS9JDTiICxw7snCXG9uIlegyHiF7DFP_h0wQRGIShoC2d4QAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experts believe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it\u2019s likely these vaccines will protect people against new variants of the virus. That being said, studies are still being conducted to test the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against these new variants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When will Canada receive the COVID-19 vaccine?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to government officials, Canada is expected to receive around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.680news.com\/2021\/02\/23\/pfizer-moderna-executives-expect-covid-19-vaccine-shipments-to-triple-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six million doses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March. By <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/health\/coronavirus\/canada-locks-in-20m-more-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-this-spring-1.5263452\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">September<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s expected we\u2019ll have procured enough vaccines for everyone in Canada who wants to be immunized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal with vaccination is to immunize enough Canadians to hit and surpass the herd immunity threshold. With herd immunity, if one person is infected with an illness, the virus dies before it can be passed to another non-immune person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the moment, there are still questions around what\u2019s needed to achieve herd immunity. Experts believe a high percentage of the population, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/7591374\/herd-immunity-covid-19-questions-alberta\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around 85%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will likely need to be immunized before a societal protection can be reached.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to plan for re-opening your office<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the COVID-19 vaccination campaign now underway across Canada, organizations have started to plan for a safe return to the office. Here are some important questions for HR teams to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. What will our new work model look like?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.benefitscanada.com\/news\/85-of-canadian-workers-want-option-to-keep-working-from-home-after-coronavirus-survey-145839\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 85% of Canadian workers want the option of working from home more frequently once offices reopen and 68% want fewer in-person meetings and training sessions. At the same time, according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5f31a311d93d0f2e28aaf04a\/t\/60007f1222541d352a6e1099\/1610645269684\/MHRC+Covid+Poll+4+National+Report+Final+-+Public+Release.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental Health Research Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 36% of Canadians claim that working exclusively from home is negatively impacting their mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, a hybrid work model is gaining popularity. This model allows for employees to come to the office when collaboration is needed, and stay home when heads-down work is required. This model puts flexibility first, which many employees have come to appreciate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though working through a pandemic has been a learning experience for employers and employees alike, workers certainly appreciate some newfound efficiencies of working remotely. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/ca\/en\/today-s-issues\/upskilling\/canadian-pulse-survey.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that 35% of remote workers have noted an increase in their productivity while 40% mentioned being equally as productive. Remote workers also save an average of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/resources.owllabs.com\/state-of-remote-work\/2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 minutes daily<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from commuting and exercise <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apollotechnical.com\/working-from-home-productivity-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 minutes more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the workweek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a whole, it\u2019s clear that employees show a growing preference for companies offering flexible work arrangements. Only <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/ca\/en\/today-s-issues\/upskilling\/canadian-pulse-survey.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Canadian workers say they would like to return to the office full-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. When should we ask employees to return to the office?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question of when and how to gradually bring employees back to the office is one of the biggest challenges organizations are facing right now. Some companies, such as Netflix, don\u2019t plan to bring employees back until <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/netflixs-reed-hastings-deems-remote-work-a-pure-negative-11599487219?mod=djemalertNEWS\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a majority<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of them have been vaccinated. Others, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadianunderwriter.ca\/insurance\/return-to-the-office-what-these-insurance-executives-say-1004202921\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CAA Insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will be bringing back workers gradually, but don\u2019t anticipate having more than 50% of its staff back in the office until at least after the third quarter of 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re planning on asking employees to return to the office before herd immunity has been achieved, make sure to put workers at the heart of your planning process. Protect employees\u2019 health and safety by:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining a clean and safe work environment, with a focus on cleaning and disinfecting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouraging employees to practise good hygiene, including washing their hands often<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requiring masks or face coverings\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviewing your sick leave policy to encourage sick employees to stay home\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redesigning spaces to promote physical distancing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasing ventilation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining flexibility for people who are at risk of more severe outcomes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important element to keep in mind is that re-opening the office isn\u2019t about bringing employees back in the same physical location. It\u2019s about developing new models of work that enhance your business while prioritizing your employees\u2019 health and safety.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. What\u2019s our change management strategy?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So much has changed since the start of the pandemic. Your employee headcount may have changed during the pandemic, and some employees may have never set foot in the office at all. Naturally, some employees will be worried about their safety \u2013 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.benefitscanada.com\/news\/bencan\/85-of-canadian-workers-want-option-to-keep-working-from-home-after-coronavirus-survey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed that 73% of Canadian workers want better cleaning protocols at their workplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To navigate change, communication will be key. You\u2019ll need support employees who are returning to the office as well as those who continue to work remotely. Since online work is different from in-person dynamics, you\u2019ll need some ice-breakers and social activities to help people build or rebuild relationships in the physical world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, you should focus on communicating a vision for the near future that employees can share and embrace. Your change management strategy should also be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/governance-insights-center\/library\/covid-19-returning-workplace-boards.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rooted in empathy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, acknowledging that everyone has faced unique challenges as a result of this worldwide crisis. You should create a plan for safety policies, answer questions, ask for feedback, and be sensitive to your staff\u2019s diverse situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering personalized mental health support during this period could also be a valuable initiative. Change is never easy, and online therapy provides a flexible solution that employees can access quickly when they\u2019re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re almost there<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The light at the end of the tunnel is finally visible, however distant it may still feel. Now\u2019s the perfect opportunity to rethink how employees work at the office, and develop new and innovative ways of working and being productive.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for new ways to support your employees\u2019 physical and mental well-being during this period of change, get in touch.
