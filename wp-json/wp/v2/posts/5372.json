It helps us to grow, make memories and rest our bodies, and it\u2019s something each one of us needs. Even though we all know how crucial sleep is to our mental health and wellbeing, almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2017009\/article\/54857\/tbl\/tbl03-eng.htm\">half of Canadians between 18 and 64<\/a> report having trouble with both falling asleep and staying asleep. Read on to learn what happens when we sleep, and how much you should actually be getting.<\/p>\n<h3>How much sleep do I need for my age?<\/h3>\n<p>Our sleep needs vary greatly\u00a0over the course of our lives. As newborns, we spend the majority of our days asleep, but as seniors, we might find that we need as little as five or six hours a night. The reasons why\u00a0have to do with where we are developmentally \u2014 more on this below. Not only do the amounts change as we age, but so do the reasons why\u00a0we need sleep. Interestingly, Statistics Canada reports that we sleep <a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2017009\/article\/54857-eng.htm\">one full hour less<\/a> as a country than we did as recently as 2005. This feeds into many theories suggesting that increased screen time has had a negative effect on our sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Experts say the easiest way to figure out the optimum number of hours for you is to pay attention to how you feel when you wake up. Both oversleeping and undersleeping can leave you feeling tired and groggy, while sleeping the right amount should result in feeling refreshed and alert. Check out our handy sleep chart by age below, to figure out your optimum range.<\/p>\n<h3>Sleep chart by age*<\/h3>\n<table style=\"width: 66.7723%; border-style: none; height: 302px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age<\/span><\/th>\n<th style=\"width: 28.9224%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recommended <\/span><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newborns: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0-3 months<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14 to 17 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infants: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4-11 months<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12 to 15 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toddlers: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1-2 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11 to 14 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preschoolers: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-5 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 to 13 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School-aged children: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6-13 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 to 11 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenagers: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14-17 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 to 10 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young adults: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18-25 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 to 9 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adults: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">26-64 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 to 9 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 43.9947%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adults: 65 and up<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 28.9224%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 to 8 hours<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Why do we sleep at night?<\/h3>\n<p>There are many reasons why\u00a0sleep is important for the brain. According to sleep therapist Aaron Arkin, sleep is just as important to our health as eating well and exercising. Says Arkin: \u201cThe brain is very active while we sleep. It undertakes all sorts of processes it can\u2019t do during the day when we\u2019re awake and alert and need to focus on actions. When our body is in a state of sleep, it can go through processes such as learning, consolidating memory and regenerating our tissues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re an infant or adolescent, your brain is learning, and growing connections while you sleep. Not just facts and people\u2019s names, but how to interact with the world. One thing we see with teenagers is that they get a lot of increased deep sleep \u2014 in the literature, it\u2019s called slow-wave sleep. And that\u2019s important for bone growth and hormone secretion. Older adults tell us that\u00a0they don\u2019t sleep deeply or as much as they used to. They\u2019re not growing the same way as when they were teenagers, so they don\u2019t need as much of that particular type of\u00a0sleep.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>What is good sleep?<\/h3>\n<p>While the amount we need varies over our lifetime, a good night\u2019s sleep has to do with more than just the total number of hours you spend asleep. Anyone with a newborn can tell you that waking up multiple times a night doesn\u2019t leave you well rested, no matter how many hours you manage to\u00a0stay in bed for. The National Sleep Foundation has outlined certain guidelines when it comes to defining a good sleep, and while basic, they make sense. According to them, you should be asleep within 30 minutes of going to bed and awakening no more than once a night. And once you\u2019ve fallen asleep, you should be awake for no longer than 20 minutes total for the entire night.<\/p>\n<h3>Core sleep<\/h3>\n<p>We hear a lot about highly successful people who sleep very few hours a night. This leaves many of us wondering what the minimum amount of sleep needed for brain function is. Although four or five hours a night might work for some tech entrepreneurs or famous businessmen-turned-politicians, Arkin cautions us against forcing ourselves into a pattern of so few hours of sleep. While we all have different sleep needs, four-and-a-half to five-and-half hours is \u201cthe minimal amount that you can get away with and still function the next day. With it, you won\u2019t be at the top of your class or performing brain surgery perhaps, but you\u2019ll be perfectly able to drive your car, do your job and interact with people.\u201d Arkin cautions that this is true provided you are able to get the right amount of sleep the following night.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of sleep can\u2019t be overstated \u2014 we&#8217;ve covered the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/lack-of-sleep-side-effects\/\">side effects of a lack of sleep<\/a> here. We all know this intuitively after a night of not getting enough sleep. It affects our mood and our mental health, and prolonged sleep deprivation is torturous \u2014 just ask anyone suffering from insomnia, or a new parent. Though a good night\u2019s sleep escapes all of us from time to time, those with recurring sleep issues often suffer real hardship.
