Their transformation from a helpless newborn to an ambulating, walking menace happens so fast it\u2019s almost unbelievable. But it doesn\u2019t always happen in a straight line. If you\u2019re wondering \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how do I encourage my baby to walk unaided<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u201d or at what age you should worry that they\u2019re still not walking, you\u2019ve come to the right place. We\u2019ve compiled everything you need from the best <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tips<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby walking<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to signs they\u2019ll soon be on their way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Signs that your baby will walk soon<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your baby is doing squats as well as pulling up on things, you can be pretty sure their first steps are a heartbeat away. From there, they\u2019re likely to move into cruising which is usually the immediate precursor to toddling. No, this doesn\u2019t mean your baby starts checking out other kids in their stroller. Cruising is when they\u2019re taking small steps while holding on to something \u2014 usually the furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some kids add another stop before they start walking known as the one knee drag. This is exactly what it sounds like, meaning they step with one foot while balancing on their knee with the other. While this might wreak havoc on the knees of their pants, it\u2019s otherwise harmless. They\u2019re likely just afraid of falling. Once their confidence catches up they\u2019ll be toddling away with their friends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I help my baby learn to walk?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your baby is going to walk on her own schedule. So if you\u2019re scouring the internet for secret <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby exercises to help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> her <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sooner, you\u2019re out of luck. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should give up on figuring out <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby walk independently<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> altogether. If you\u2019re super focused on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to help your baby walk sooner,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">try getting them to crawl or shimmy over different height surfaces, like pillows. This helps them to practice shifting their weight around which will improve their balance. Learning to navigate uneven surfaces will also boost their confidence which they\u2019ll need to take their first independent steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baby<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taking steps but not walking<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> yet, don\u2019t worry! While some kids let go and attempt multiple steps right off the bat, don\u2019t be surprised if your little one takes a more cautious approach. You can encourage them to go longer distances by moving a few inches away and letting them try walking to you. Holding up a favorite item like (gasp) your phone is an added incentive \u2014 just make sure it\u2019s in a good case in case they actually get it!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The best shoes for baby\u2019s first steps<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few different brands claim the title of best <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shoes for baby\u2019s first steps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but that doesn\u2019t make them must-buy items. Most baby shoes will fit the bill, as long as they meet certain criteria. First of all, shoes should be easy to get on. No high tops, for example (they may be super cute, but they\u2019re practically impossible to get on a baby\u2019s foot). Next up, it\u2019s a good idea to find a pair of shoes with decent grip on the bottom. Leather crib shoes are usually fine, but they don\u2019t always provide the traction your baby needs on a slippery floor which can make for some nasty spills. Finally, the shoe should be flexible and comfy. Your baby should have enough space to be able to grip with their toes inside the shoe. Otherwise they\u2019re likely to be both uncomfortable and unsteady.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When do babies start walking?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">babies<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> take their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first steps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caringforkids.cps.ca\/handouts\/behavior-and-development\/your_childs_development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with some beginning as early as nine months and others as late as 15 months. But that doesn\u2019t mean you need to start stressing if your child falls outside of this range. \u201cNormal\u201d is a spectrum, so unless your baby isn\u2019t walking by 18 months, there\u2019s no need to take them to the doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When to worry<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your baby isn\u2019t walking by 18 months, they\u2019re more than likely just a late bloomer. Despite that, they should be seen by a doctor anyways as late walking is sometimes associated with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/health-topics\/aa56609\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cerebral palsy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that your child has cerebral palsy if they\u2019re not walking by 18 months. Poor muscle tone, stiffness in the joints and seemingly uncontrolled movements are all potential signs of cerebral palsy, and are more likely than not walking to be the first signs a parent spots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every group of babies has an early walker and a late one. Most other parents have enough tact not to say things like, \u201che\u2019s not walking yet?!\u201d but it\u2019s often the voice in your own head that causes the most worry. If possible, try not to compare your child to your friends\u2019 kids. We all do things on our own schedule and your child is no exception. With any luck, he\u2019ll <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/goodbye-diapers-hello-potty-training-methods\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potty train<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 22 months and learn to make his bed by three. As always, if you\u2019re at all concerned, speak to your child\u2019s pediatrician.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most babies walk somewhere around 12 months, but your baby&#8217;s first steps might not happen then.
