But just because something\u2019s common, doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s normal. Chronic digestive issues might be a signal that something more sinister is going on with your health. Here are some of the most common digestive issues, and what they can tell you about your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Constipation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constipation is one of the most common digestive complaints. It has a number of causes from not drinking enough fluids to taking certain medications. Like the rest of the body, your digestion slows down as you age, so constipation tends to become more of an issue as you get older. But even if you\u2019re in the 50+ crowd, chronic constipation shouldn\u2019t be a daily occurrence. If you\u2019ve always struggled with sluggish digestion, chatting with a dietician or adding a fibre supplement to your diet can help. But you should always discuss any sudden gastrointestinal changes with a doctor as it might signal something more serious. Chronic constipation can be a sign of colorectal cancer or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.michaeljfox.org\/news\/constipation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parkinson\u2019s disease<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example. But whether it\u2019s a sign of ageing or of an underlying health issue, there are a number of treatments. Chronic constipation doesn\u2019t have to be a fact of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bloating<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloating happens when air gets trapped in your digestive tract. It&#8217;s incredibly common, and like many gastrointestinal difficulties, usually caused by foods. So-called cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage are common culprits, but fatty foods and soda are also a major cause, as is chewing gum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while bloating happens to everyone from time-to-time, if you\u2019re experiencing it regularly, it could be cause for concern. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance and celiac disease all cause bloating and they\u2019re not likely to go away without medication or lifestyle adjustments. And not to be alarming, but regular bloating is one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ovariancanada.org\/About-Ovarian-Cancer\/Detection\/Signs-Symptoms#:~:text=Common%20symptoms%20include%3A,Urinary%20symptoms%20%2D%20urgency%20or%20frequency\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first signs of ovarian cancer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It can also manifest in patients with other forms of cancer such as colon and stomach cancer. If you\u2019re experiencing regular bloating that doesn\u2019t go away despite diet changes, you should consult with a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Diarrhea<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most other digestive complaints, the occasional bout of diarrhea is normal. Food or illness are often the most likely causes and most cases tend to resolve within a few days. Chronic diarrhea, however, is another story. In an immunocompromised individual, chronic diarrhea can have grave consequences including dehydration and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/healthywater\/hygiene\/disease\/chronic_diarrhea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even death<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But even a seemingly healthy person experiencing chronic diarrhea should investigate the cause. Chronic diarrhea is one of the first signs of HIV infection, and individuals with the virus can seem healthy for many years after infection while the virus continues to replicate. HIV isn\u2019t the most likely cause, but chronic diarrhea might also be a symptom of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/irritable-bowel-syndrome-symptoms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">irritable bowel syndrome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a food intolerance or even <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/journal.diabetes.org\/clinicaldiabetes\/V18N42000\/pg148.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diabetes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you experience loose stools for longer than two weeks, it\u2019s a good idea to reach out to a doctor for advice.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Fecal incontinence<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fecal incontinence can have profound effects on self-esteem and social interactions. It typically results from damage to or weakening of the rectum or anus, often a by-product of ageing or trauma. In women, pelvic floor problems due to pregnancy, labour and delivery can cause it, for example. And both obesity and gastric bypass surgery may increase your risk for fecal incontinence. But whether you think you know what\u2019s causing it or not, seeing your doctor about fecal incontinence is a must. That\u2019s because it can also be a sign of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gi.org\/topics\/fecal-incontinence\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crohn\u2019s disease<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.continence.org.au\/data\/files\/Factsheets\/Diabetes__bladder__bowel_control_-_Sept_2011.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poorly controlled diabetes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which leads to nerve damage in the bladder and bowel). Whatever the cause, there are a number of treatments for fecal incontinence including specific exercises, medications and dietary changes. Fecal incontinence is unlikely to resolve on its own, so you\u2019re better off seeking treatment, not suffering in silence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the occasional bout of tummy trouble likely isn\u2019t anything to worry about, daily digestive issues shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If you\u2019re experiencing regular bouts of diarrhea, constipation or any other digestive complaints, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chronic digestive health problems mean something isn&#8217;t right.
