But if you\u2019re currently pregnant, the COVID-19 situation has likely taken your anxiety levels to new heights. Every sniffle is suspect right now, and many are wondering how the COVID-19 pandemic is going to affect their pregnancy. We\u2019ve assembled the most up-to-date facts to help you sift through all the information.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Is COVID-19 dangerous for my pregnancy?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with the good news. In an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/6661429\/pregnant-coronavirus-risks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview with Global news<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our CEO and emergency room physician, Dr. Brett Belchetz said, \u201cThere is no evidence that pregnant women are at increased risk from COVID-19.\u201d While pregnant women are more vulnerable to other respiratory viruses such as the flu or SARS, as far as we know, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s the case with COVID-19. Despite this, pregnant women have been designated as part of a \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rcog.org.uk\/en\/guidelines-research-services\/guidelines\/coronavirus-pregnancy\/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vulnerable group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d as pregnancy can affect how your body handles viral infections in a small number of women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been a limited number of reports of COVID-19-infected mothers giving <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.acog.org\/clinical\/clinical-guidance\/practice-advisory\/articles\/2020\/03\/novel-coronavirus-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birth prematurely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but there is currently no information suggesting the virus increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects or other complications. And when it comes to your new baby, the available information seems to show that most children don\u2019t get very sick from the virus. The risk may be greater, however, in children with underlying medical conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>I think I have COVID-19 and I\u2019m pregnant. What should I do?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are having trouble breathing, dial 9-1-1 immediately. If your symptoms are mild, however, you should begin by being screened for coronavirus. You probably don\u2019t want to head into the doctor\u2019s office right now, but thankfully there\u2019s the option of online <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/covid-19-screening\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coronavirus screening<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some assessment centers won\u2019t take you without a referral from a doctor, so avoid showing up without one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your test does come back positive, call your OB or your midwife and explain the situation. Don\u2019t show up to their office in person, or you risk infecting them and their other patients. It\u2019s understandable that the thought of being pregnant and having COVID-19 is scary. But unless your healthcare provider tells you to, you should also refrain from going to the hospital. Most people who get the virus are fine and recover without needing hospitalization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What happens if I get COVID-19 and then go into labour?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Belchetz reassures us that so far \u201cthere is no evidence that COVID infection is passed on to the fetus or has any effect on the fetus.\u201d If you have tested positive for COVID-19 and are in labour, ideally you and your healthcare provider will have developed a plan ahead of time. If not, call the hospital and let them know you\u2019re coming. This lets them prepare for your arrival so you get the care you need without the risk of infecting others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have COVID-19 but are still planning a hospital birth, don\u2019t be worried about going to the hospital. Labour and delivery wards are typically separate areas in each hospital. As well, hospitals have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals.html#i\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific procedures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for dealing with possible cases of COVID-19 infection, so you don\u2019t have to worry that you\u2019ll be sharing space with someone with the illness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Can I breastfeed if I have COVID-19?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We currently have no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted in breast milk. But because there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn\u2019t have<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/pregnant-women-faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> official guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on breastfeeding for mothers with the disease yet. Each mother should discuss her unique situation with her healthcare provider to determine what\u2019s best for her and her child.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What should I do to make sure I don\u2019t get COVID-19 while pregnant?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best thing you can do to reduce your risk is to eliminate unnecessary exposure. According to Dr. Belchetz, \u201cPregnant women should take all the same precautions as the general public, such as avoiding sick people and public gatherings, frequently washing hands and sanitizing surfaces.\u201d If you do go out for a walk, make sure to maintain a minimum of at least six feet between yourself and others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following all the dos and don\u2019ts of pregnancy is hard enough without having to worry about a global pandemic. It might sound simple, but staying home and washing your hands are two of the best things we can all do to keep ourselves, and each other, safe right now. Continue to practice social distancing and monitor your body. And if you have concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to a doctor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to COVID-19 and pregnancy should you be concerned?
