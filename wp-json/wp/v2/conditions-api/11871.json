COPD causes inflammation and blockage of the lungs as well. In North America, it\u2019s usually caused by prolonged exposure to chemicals that harm the lungs, like those found in cigarettes.<\/p>\n<p>COPD is a general term. Most often, COPD stems from two types of respiratory conditions: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It affects over 2 million Canadians over 35, and can significantly decrease mobility, and inhibit daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of bronchi, which are the main passageways to the lungs. It also causes the overproduction of mucus, which further blocks air from traveling in and out of the lungs.<\/p>\n<p>Emphysema is a progressive lung disease that damages the lung\u2019s alveoli (air sacs), causing them to weaken and break. Healthy lungs have many small air sacs, whereas lungs affected by emphysema have large air sacs, because the walls between the small sacs have ruptured from damage. This makes it harder to push air out, causing fatigue and difficulty breathing.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no cure for COPD, but the condition can be managed with proper care.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of COPD?","accordion_intro":"<p>COPD doesn\u2019t cause immediate symptoms.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein produced by the liver, and some people have a natural deficiency that causes the liver to produce low amounts of Alpha-1-antitrypsin, causing poor lung development.<\/p>\n<p>COPD can also occur because of age, as evidenced by the fact that a vast majority of those living with COPD are over 35.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>Several triggers can cause COPD to worsen.

Usually, to diagnose COPD a doctor will ask questions about your medical history, and look for details regarding exposure to any chemicals that could have damaged your lungs, including your smoking history.<\/p>\n<p>There are also several tests that can help with COPD diagnosis, like chest X Rays, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis (a test that shows how well your blood is carrying oxygen throughout your body), a CT scan to take a closer look at your lungs and determine the extent of the damage, or a lab test for the rare chance that you have alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How is COPD treated?","accordion_intro":"<p>There is treatment for COPD symptoms, but no COPD cure.<\/p>\n<p>If you smoke, quitting cigarettes will make the most significant difference in your lung health.<\/p>\n<p>Other COPD treatments include medications like inhalers (puffers) that make breathing easier. There are a few different types of inhalers that are common:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bronchodilator Inhalers: these open up the airways to the lungs. There are two common types \u2014 beta2-agonist and anticholinergics. Both can be used for quick relief and for longer term support.<\/li>\n<li>Combination Inhalers: these are taken daily as COPD maintenance treatment. They\u2019re often a combination of several medicines in one inhaler. These medications help reduce swelling in the airways and shortness of breath longer-term.<\/li>\n<li>Nebulizer Medication: For people who have trouble using inhalers, a nebulizer mists the medication through a mask that\u2019s held against the face<\/li>\n<li>Preventing illnesses that are hard on your lungs by getting flu shots and avoiding close proximity with those who are ill.<\/li>\n<li>In some cases, a home oxygen supply in combination with other medicines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>During a COPD flare up, treatment can range from inhalers to mechanical intervention, depending on the severity.
