Individuals often report feeling out of control during these periods of over consumption, and often hoard food secretly.<\/p>\n<h6>Bulimia nervosa<\/h6>\n<p>As with many eating disorders, individuals with bulimia will often try to hide their disordered eating habits.

Perfectionism and having a relative with an eating disorder are other factors that increase an individual\u2019s risk. Some eating disorders like ARFID, Pica and rumination disorder, often begin in childhood as the result of a biological issue (such as a vitamin deficiency), or as the result of a traumatic experience such as choking. Addressing the underlying cause of the behaviour is crucial for a successful recovery from an eating disorder.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How are eating disorders treated?","accordion_intro":"<p>Treating eating disorders often involves a multi-modal approach such as personalized nutritional support, seeing a therapist or counsellor, and medication. Registered dieticians can help eating-disordered individuals reestablish healthy eating habits with customized nutrition plans. For many individuals with eating disorders, therapy and medication are necessary as well to address underlying feelings of anxiety and\/or depression, and to change negative thought patterns and actions. ARFID treatment may involve body work (deep breathing techniques, yoga) in addition to traditional eating disorder treatment, in order to calm panic, while individuals with Pica may be given supplements to address any underlying vitamin or mineral deficiencies.<\/p>\n<p>In life-threatening eating disorder cases, patients may require hospitalization and intravenous feeding. Certain individuals may also benefit from admission to an eating disorder clinic for around-the-clock monitoring and in-patient eating disorder treatment programs.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What is Maple?","accordion_intro":"<div aria-hidden=\"false\">\n<p>With Maple, you can start talking to a doctor about your symptoms in a matter of minutes.
