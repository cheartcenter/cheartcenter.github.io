More specifically, it\u2019s used to describe a pigment called melanin, created by special cells in our skin.<\/p>\n<p>When these special cells become unhealthy or get damaged, melanin production is affected. Pigment disorders refer to skin conditions caused resulting from changes in our skin colouring. Some of these conditions may be contained to a small area of the body, while others could affect the whole body.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>There are a number of different types of pigment disorders, each with their own direct causes.

All pigment disorders result from some change in the melanin in our skin.<\/p>\n<p>Albinism is an inherited condition, so this pigment disorder is caused by genetics.<\/p>\n<p>Melasma is caused by changes in the hormone estrogen, which is why it&#8217;s more commonly found in women than men. This condition can sometimes be triggered by pregnancy, and fade on its own when hormone levels return to normal.<\/p>\n<p>Both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are pigment disorders that are caused by damage to skin.<br \/>\nVitiligo is an autoimmune disease, so this condition is a result of our own immune system attacking pigment cells.<\/p>\n<p>Infant Jaundice is caused by an excess of bilirubin in the baby&#8217;s blood, which is a yellow pigment produced when red blood cells are broken down. Bilirubin (a yellow substance) is normally removed from the blood in the liver. Levels become high, and potentially toxic when too much bilirubin is made faster than it can be removed.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How are pigment disorders diagnosed?","accordion_intro":"<p>In order to diagnose pigment disorders, the healthcare provider will want to discuss your personal and family medical histories.
