It occurs as a result of high amounts of uric acid in your bloodstream, and forms needle-like crystals. These crystals begin to not only cause arthritis, but since they block kidney filtering tubules, they can also cause kidney stones and other kidney issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple stages of gout:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asymptomatic hyperuricemia \u2014 The period prior to a goat attack.
