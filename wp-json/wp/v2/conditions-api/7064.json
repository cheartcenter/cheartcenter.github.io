Some people even believe that hemorrhoids are a natural result of blood vessels fighting gravity, because human beings stand upright.<\/p>\n<p>The most direct cause of hemorrhoids is bulging or swelling veins. These tend to stretch under pressure, which means that hemorrhoids can develop due to increased pressure in the lower rectum.

Depending on the severity of your condition, the doctor may also suggest a visual inspection or digital examination at a medical facility.<\/p>\n<p>Less commonly, if the doctor believes your hemorrhoids or rectal bleeding could be signs of another condition, they may suggest a colonoscopy.
