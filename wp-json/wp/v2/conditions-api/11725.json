PMS causes mild depression and manageable anxiety. As a result, PMS treatment can sometimes be as simple as making a few changes to everyday habits like exercise and diet.<\/p>\n<p>PMDD can cause feelings of deep anxiety and depression that are often hard to overcome, and sometimes lead people towards self harm.

Some studies relate a drop in serotonin \u2014 which is a chemical our brains release when we\u2019re happy \u2014 to hormonal changes that happen in the body before menstruation begins. This might be the reason mood instability happens so often during PMS and PMDD.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How are PMS and PMDD treated?","accordion_intro":"<p>Both medicine and lifestyle changes can be treatments for premenstrual syndrome. Some PMS symptoms, like nausea, can be treated with over the counter medications. Mood swings related to PMS can sometimes be reduced by increasing exercise, proper rest, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes people need prescription medication to help rebalance their emotions. In this case, antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) might be prescribed, usually as treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Zoloft and Celexa are examples of SSRIs used as PPMD medication.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How long does PMS last?","accordion_intro":"<p>PMS usually lasts for about 7-14 days before the start of menstruation.<\/p>\n<p>PMDD and PMS can mimic other disorders like depression, so to differentiate, it\u2019s important to ensure that feelings of low mood are only happening in the weeks leading up to menstruation. If these feelings are more constant, the mood imbalance may be chronic, and not correlated to PMS or PMDD.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What is Maple?","accordion_intro":"<div aria-hidden=\"false\">\n<p>With Maple, you can start talking to a doctor about your symptoms in a matter of minutes.
