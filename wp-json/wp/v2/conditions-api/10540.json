Not everyone experiences the stages in the same order, and sometimes, symptoms from different stages can happen all at once.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Primary Stage<\/strong>: The primary stage begins at the moment of infection, though syphilis has an incubation period of about 3 weeks (and up to 90 days). It\u2019s defined by the presence of a syphilis chancre, which is a sore that appears on the genitals of the infected person. The sore is a painless bump (in some cases it may be a wet sore), so it can easily go unnoticed, or be mistaken for something else like an ingrown hair. On men, the chancre often appears on the penis, but it can also appear on the scrotum. Women may develop a chancre on the vulva or vagina, or sometimes, deep inside their cervix. Both men and women can develop chancres in their rectums, and rarely, in their mouths. Swelling of the lymph nodes in areas near the chancre are a clue that you may have syphilis.<\/p>\n<p>During this stage, a person with syphilis is extremely contagious. The sore clears up on it\u2019s own in about 3 weeks, but that doesn\u2019t mean the person is syphilis free.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p><strong>Secondary Syphilis<\/strong>: The secondary stage starts around 2-8 weeks after the primary stage, and symptoms may appear, heal, and reappear for years.<\/p>\n<p>During the secondary stage, a syphilis rash usually develops on the inside of an infected person\u2019s hands, the soles of their feet, and occasionally on other body parts. It\u2019s reddish brown, and can sometimes be so faint it isn\u2019t noticeable \u2014 especially since it\u2019s not usually itchy either. It usually heals on its own in about 8 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>A healed rash doesn\u2019t mean a person no longer has syphilis. And during the secondary stage, like the primary stage, a person with syphilis is highly contagious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Latent Syphilis<\/strong>:This phase is also sometimes called the hidden phase, because at this point, people with syphilis no longer have a chancre or rashes. There are no evident symptoms of syphilis.<\/p>\n<p>But the treponema pallidum bacterium that causes the syphilis infection is still at work in the body. During this phase, symptoms may not reappear for as long as a year. In some cases, syphilis may remain latent in a person\u2019s system for up to 20 years. This gravely increases the chances of long-term illnesses related to syphilis, like neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone with syphilis experiences this stage. With regular testing with early treatment it can be avoided.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tertiary Syphilis<\/strong>: This stage occurs in 15% to 30% of people who contract syphilis if they don\u2019t receive treatment. At this advanced stage, damage may be done to the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, the liver, bones, and joints. It\u2019s the most dangerous stage of syphilis because it can leave the most long-lasting effects.
