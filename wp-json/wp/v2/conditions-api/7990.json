Common over-the-counter pain relievers can be very helpful (think acetaminophen and ibuprofen), but the doctor may suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol, although narcotics are best avoided, as they are addictive. Antidepressants can help with pain and fatigue symptoms, and muscle relaxants can help with sleep. Finally, some anti-seizure drugs are often useful in helping with fibromyalgia symptoms.
