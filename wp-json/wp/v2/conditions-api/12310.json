It\u2019s a very contagious condition, which can be spread by accidentally inhaling or ingesting microscopic pinworm eggs.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, pinworms can be found in kids between the ages of 5 and 10, people who live in close-quarter institutions or those who have close contact with people in the first two groups.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of a pinworm infection?","accordion_intro":"<p>Pinworm symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Severe or regular itchiness in the anal area, especially at night<\/li>\n<li>Rash, pain or skin irritation around the anus<\/li>\n<li>Finding pinworms in stool<\/li>\n<li>Agitation or irritability<\/li>\n<li>Restless sleep due to itching and discomfort<\/li>\n<li>Sporadic abdominal pain<\/li>\n<li>Itching in the vaginal area<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What causes a pinworm infection?","accordion_intro":"<p>Female pinworms lay eggs in the folds of skin around the anus, before returning to the colon. This is done during the night and as a result, causes the itching symptom in the area where the eggs are laid.<\/p>\n<p>Pinworm infections occur when those itchy areas are scratched, and the pinworm eggs are transferred to hands or other objects. They will then infect a new host if those eggs are inhaled or ingested.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, young children put their hands and other random objects into their mouths on a regular basis, which is why it\u2019s common to find pinworms in kids.<\/p>\n<p>The pinworm life cycle is approximately 13 weeks long. However, because pinworm eggs can survive on contaminated surfaces (bedding, toilet seats, toys or clothing) for up to 3 weeks, they\u2019re very easy to spread. Reinfection is much more likely when contaminated surfaces aren\u2019t thoroughly cleaned while treating a pinworm infection.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How is a pinworm infection diagnosed?","accordion_intro":"<p>A doctor will offer a pinworm diagnosis after evaluating you for the existence of pinworms or pinworm eggs.<\/p>\n<p>Frequently, this involves doing a \u2018tape test\u2019.
