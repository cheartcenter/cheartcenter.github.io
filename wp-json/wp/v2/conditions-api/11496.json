Growth hormone is typically given in childhood and adolescence to help individuals attain a more \u201cnormal\u201d height. Most preteen girls with Turner syndrome also require estrogen replacement therapy to stimulate puberty. Many women with Turner syndrome take this medication throughout their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Women with Turner syndrome have a higher risk of developing heart and kidney issues, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and bone issues. Those that develop these issues often need additional medical treatment for these health conditions. Life expectancy with Turner syndrome is somewhat shorter than typical, especially if individuals suffer from concurrent health issues. But if these concerns are properly managed, the prognosis for Turner syndrome is usually positive, and individuals can live a long and healthy life.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What is Maple?","accordion_intro":"<div aria-hidden=\"false\">\n<p>With Maple, you can start talking to a doctor about your symptoms in a matter of minutes.
