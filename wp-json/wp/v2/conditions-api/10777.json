There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Symptoms vary, and HIV-1 is much more prevalent, versus HIV-2, which is carried by a very small number of people.<\/p>\n<p>HIV develops in stages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute HIV Infection<\/strong> is the earliest stage, when the virus attacks the immune system and begins to reduce the cd4 count. These cd4 cells are what the body needs to fight infections, so most people get an HIV related flu or rash during this phase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Chronic HIV Infection<\/strong> is the second stage, where people with HIV who are taking antiretroviral medication (ARTs) usually have low amounts of the virus in their system, and can live a normal healthy life. Without medication, this stage progresses to AIDS in 5-10 years.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)<\/strong> is the final stage of HIV. At this stage, the body\u2019s immune system is too weak to fight infections, so people easily get sick and find it increasingly difficult to recover.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of HIV?
