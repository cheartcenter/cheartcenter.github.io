Non-diabetic hypoglycemia has a number of causes, including medications, excessive alcohol consumption, kidney disorders, long-term starvation, liver disease, pancreatic disease, and hormone deficiencies.

","accordion_intro":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypoglycemia treatment involves a two-pronged approach: immediate treatment to raise blood sugar and treating the underlying condition. Initial symptoms can often be treated easily by consuming 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as fruit juice, sugary candy, and regular soft drinks. If symptoms become severe, you may need injections of glucagon (if you have frequent bouts of hypoglycemia, you can get an at-home glucagon kit), or intravenous infusions of glucose.<\/span><\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the cause of your hypoglycemia, you may have to adjust medication dosage or change medications, address anorexia, and\/or treat tumors.
