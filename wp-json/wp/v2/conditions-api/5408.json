If the insect or arachnid that bit or stung you dies after your encounter, collect it to bring to the doctor.

You can also apply a paste made of water and baking soda to the affected area, to reduce itchiness.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>In some cases, the doctor may suggest prescription bites and stings medications, such as antihistamines, topical anti-itch creams, or oral pain relievers to relieve symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve experienced bee stings, remove the stinger if it&#8217;s still lodged in the skin.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you believe you could have a tick lodged in your skin, don&#8217;t try to remove it at home. Visit a medical clinic immediately, and a professional will help to safely remove the tick.<\/p>\n<p>Treatments for spider bites and stings can vary depending on the type of spider involved. If you believe you could have been bitten by a black widow or brown recluse spider, you should seek immediate medical attention. This is true even if you aren&#8217;t showing symptoms yet.<\/p>\n<p>In order to treat some bites and stings, you will also have to address insect infestations as part of the treatment. For example, lice, mites, or bed bugs will need to be exterminated from living areas in order to prevent future attacks.<\/p>\n<p>All scorpion stings should be treated in an emergency room.<\/p>\n","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"When to see a doctor for bites and stings?","accordion_intro":"<p>If your bites and stings symptoms are chronic or severe, it&#8217;s a good idea to talk to a doctor.
