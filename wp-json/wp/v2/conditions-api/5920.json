When you&#8217;re obese, it can increase the risks of experiencing other health problems, like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.<br \/>\nObesity is calculated using the body mass index (BMI). BMI is measured by calculating body weight (in kg) divided by height (in metres) squared. If the resulting number is 30 or higher, the weight is considered obese.<\/p>\n<p>You can also calculate obesity by measuring waist circumferences. It\u2019s best used in patients who have a BMI that\u2019s considered overweight (between 25 to 29.9 kg\/m2), and increased abdominal girth, to assess cardiometabolic risks.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>People who are chronically obese are more likely to develop a number of other serious medical conditions, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Osteoarthritis<\/li>\n<li>Sleep apnea<\/li>\n<li>Thrombosis<\/li>\n<li>Certain types of cancer<\/li>\n<li>Type 2 diabetes<\/li>\n<li>Severe Covid-19 symptoms<\/li>\n<li>Gynecological and sexual disorders<\/li>\n<li>Heart disease<\/li>\n<li>Stroke<\/li>\n<li>Diabetes<\/li>\n<li>High cholesterol<\/li>\n<li>Gout<\/li>\n<li>GERD<\/li>\n<li>Reduced fertility<\/li>\n<li>Lowered sex drive<\/li>\n<li>Erectile dysfunction<\/li>\n<li>Kidney stones<\/li>\n<li>Urinary incontinence<\/li>\n<li>Higher risk of infections<\/li>\n<li>Increased mortality rates from influenza and COVID-19 viruses<\/li>\n<li>Chronic kidney disease<\/li>\n<li>Mental illness (depression, stigma of disapproval)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of obesity?","accordion_intro":"<p>The most prominent symptom or sign of obesity is weight gain, pushing your BMI to 30 or higher.

If you&#8217;re experiencing signs of obesity, you may even require more calories before feeling full.

They&#8217;ll do this by first suggesting a weight-loss program that will work for you, and may refer you to a dietician to help you create a healthy meal plan. All weight-loss programs will involve reducing calories, practicing better eating habits, and increasing the volume of physical activities you perform.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may need to work on modifying your routine behaviors to help you stick to your weight loss program. These types of obesity treatments involve participating in support groups or counseling.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>If your obesity is being caused by a hormone imbalance, they may suggest an obesity prescription to help return hormones to normal levels.<\/p>\n<p>Less commonly, when a healthy diet and regular exercise aren&#8217;t enough to reduce obesity symptoms, the doctor may suggest prescription obesity medications. However, these obesity medications may not work for everyone. You may also regain some or all of the weight you lost when you stop taking the medication.<\/p>\n<p>In some people, weight-loss surgery (also known as bariatric surgery) may be an option.
