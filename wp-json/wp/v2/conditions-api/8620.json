Diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce insulin or when tissues in your body become insensitive to insulin, and glucose builds up in your blood. There are a number of types of diabetes, including those that are chronic (Type 1 and 2) and temporary (gestational diabetes). <\/span><\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Type 1 diabetes, typically referred to as juvenile diabetes, usually occurs in youth, and often initially presents with a life threatening episode of high blood sugar and dehydration.

All types of diabetes can be managed by exercising regularly and eating foods that are lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Additionally, type 1 diabetes treatment typically involves the use of an insulin pump or regular insulin injections, as well as frequent blood sugar checks.\u00a0 In extremely rare cases, pancreas transplants may be used. Type 2 diabetes can be treated with medication, insulin, or both (as well as lifestyle changes). And depending on the severity of your gestational diabetes, you may also need insulin or medication.
