Of those, some types of HPV cause cancer, and some types of HPV cause genital warts. Others go away completely on their own, and many people who have HPV don\u2019t know it, as they don\u2019t show any symptoms at all.<\/p>\n<p>An estimated 75% of sexually active Canadians have had HPV once in their lifetime.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of HPV?","accordion_intro":"<p>Most people with human papillomavirus (HPV) don\u2019t have symptoms at all.<\/p>\n<p>Because there are so many different types of HPV, each type is identified by a number.<br \/>\nHPV types 6 and 11 cause genital warts. They\u2019re considered a low risk version of human papillomavirus. That\u2019s because genital warts (small bumps on the skin of the genitals and anus that resemble cauliflower) are relatively harmless, although sometimes uncomfortable. They can be removed in the same way that a wart on your hands or feet can be treated. Most notably, HPV 6 and 11 do not lead to cancer. Still, it\u2019s important to talk to a doctor right away if you have untreated genital warts.<\/p>\n<p>In men, warts are found on the penis, scrotum, or anus. In women, warts can grow on the cervix, vulva, vaginal walls, anus, and in the general pubic area.<\/p>\n<p>High-risk HPV, strains 16 and 18, can lead to penile and anal cancer, as well as cancer of the vulva and throat. Unfortunately high-risk HPV doesn\u2019t have any symptoms in the early stages before becoming cancerous. That\u2019s why regular checkups and screenings are so important.<\/p>\n<p>If HPV becomes cancer, symptoms eventually appear that vary according to where the cancer is present. HPV can lead to penile cancer, anal cancer, throat cancer, and cervical cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Cervical cancer is the cancer most commonly linked to HPV. Symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discharge that\u2019s either abnormal or noticeably increased compared to average vaginal discharge.
