A golden-coloured crust will form in the center of the spots and spread out to the edge.<\/p>\n<p>These oozing sores can be painful and are extremely contagious.<\/p>\n<p>If left untreated, impetigo can become a more serious condition, known as ecthyma.

If there are a lot of sores, the doctor may recommend a course of oral antibiotics. Always be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if the impetigo blisters disappear, to prevent the infection from returning.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, you may need to soak the area or use a wet compress to remove the scabs on top, in order for the antibiotic cream to penetrate the sores.<\/p>\n<p>If the sores don&#8217;t clear up after a full treatment of antibiotics, the doctor may request lab tests on the liquid from inside the sores, to find the best type of antibiotics to fight the infection.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"How long does impetigo last?","accordion_intro":"<p>Without treatment, an impetigo infection will usually clear up on its own in two to three weeks.<\/p>\n<p>However, because of how contagious impetigo can be, it&#8217;s recommended to seek treatment to prevent it from spreading to others.

This is the same virus that can cause chickenpox.<\/p>\n<p>Impetigo on the other hand isn&#8217;t as painful, although it is extremely contagious.
