Herpes is caused by a different sexually transmitted infection called herpes simplex virus. They\u2019re both transmitted in similar ways, but aren\u2019t the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike herpes, genital warts primarily exist in the moist flesh of the genitals. They\u2019re small bumps that resemble cauliflower, and are usually flesh-coloured. If left untreated, HPV can lead to cancer in the rectum and mouth in both men and women. Women are also at a higher risk of cervical cancer if they have HPV.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of genital herpes?

","accordion_intro":"<p>There are two common types of herpes simplex virus. HSV1, which typically causes oral cold sores, and HSV2, which typically causes genital herpes. Receiving oral sex from a person with a cold sore can lead to genital herpes, though HSV1 transmission that way is rare.<\/p>\n<p>Herpes transmission is more common from an infected male to female partner. HSV1 transmission through kissing is also possible, especially if one partner is experiencing an outbreak.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"Can genital herpes be detected if dormant? ","accordion_intro":"<p>Typically, no. A genital herpes diagnosis is difficult to reach conclusively while herpes is dormant. In rare cases, a doctor may order a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

","accordion_intro":"<p>Genital herpes spreads through skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal and oral sex. It can spread even if herpes is dormant (no visible sores), though that lowers the chances of transmission.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t get herpes from towels or surfaces like toilet seats.<\/p>\n<p>Preventing genital herpes can be difficult because it can affect areas that are not protected by condom use \u2014 like the labia, scrotum, upper thigh, and buttocks. Condoms and dental dams still can play a big part in preventing the spread, and are important in minimizing the spread. Getting tested regularly, and avoiding sex with partners who are currently experiencing an outbreak also lessens the chances of contracting herpes.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"Is genital herpes curable?
