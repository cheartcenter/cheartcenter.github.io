Bacterial pneumonia is treated with oral antibiotics. Viral pneumonia can clear on its own with at-home care, but doctors do occasionally prescribe antiviral medication. And fungal pneumonias are treated with antifungal medications.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>At-home care typically involves over-the-counter pain and fever reducers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Cough medicines can help calm a cough, but coughing helps clear the lungs so it\u2019s recommended to use these medications with caution.
