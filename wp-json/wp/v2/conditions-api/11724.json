It can cause itching, a burning sensation, and pain during sex.<\/p>\n<p>The three most common types of vaginitis are:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/yeast-infection-treatment\/\">Yeast Infection<\/a>: The vagina produces a certain amount of yeast naturally, but other physical conditions can cause an unhealthy excess of yeast cells to be produced. This can be caused by antibiotics, pregnancy, birth control, or hormone therapy to name a few causes. Yeast infections are more common in people with weakened immune systems.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment\/\">Bacterial Vaginosis<\/a>: Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an overgrowth of vaginal bacteria. Using an IUD, smoking, vaginal douching, or having an STI increases the chances of bacterial vaginosis.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/conditions\/trichomoniasis-treatment\/\">Trichomoniasis<\/a>: Trichomoniasis, also called Trich, is a vaginal infection caused by a parasite called trichomonas.
