However, it can be extremely painful. Getting early treatment for shingles is important, because it can help shorten the length of the infection and reduce the chance of complications.<\/p>\n<p>Shingles typically last between two to six weeks. While most people will only get shingles one time, it is possible to get it more than once. If you\u2019re over the age of 50 you can be vaccinated against shingles, which can substantially reduce your chances of experiencing the painful condition.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, the vaccine can reduce the severity, duration of pain, and prevent complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia (pain that lasts longer than the rash).<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of shingles?","accordion_intro":"<p>The most commonly occurring symptoms and signs of shingles include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Itching<\/li>\n<li>Sensitivity to touch<\/li>\n<li>Burning, numbness, or tingling<\/li>\n<li>Moderate to severe shooting or stabbing pain (typically localized to one side of the body)<\/li>\n<li>Fluid-filled blisters, which burst and crust over<\/li>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Upset stomach<\/li>\n<li>Sensitivity to light<\/li>\n<li>Headache<\/li>\n<li>Fever or chills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What causes shingles?","accordion_intro":"<p>The same virus that causes chicken pox, the varicella-zoster virus, also causes shingles.
