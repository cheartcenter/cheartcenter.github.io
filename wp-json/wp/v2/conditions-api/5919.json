It helps our bodies in several ways, including being converted into certain hormones, and helping to build healthy cells.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main types of cholesterol low-density lipoprotein (LDL or &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL or &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol). Too much of any type of cholesterol can be bad. However, people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people with high LDL.<\/p>\n<p>High cholesterol levels can cause fatty deposits to form in your blood vessels, a process known as atherosclerosis. If these deposits grow large enough, it can make it difficult for blood to flow through your arteries. It can also cause dangerous clots to form.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of high cholesterol?","accordion_intro":"<p>Most people won&#8217;t experience any symptoms or signs of high cholesterol until there is a very significant narrowing of the arteries caused by atherosclerotic plaques.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, high cholesterol can cause symptoms, such as pain in the part of the body that isn\u2019t getting enough blood. High cholesterol can also cause symptoms when a plaque gets too big. If it ruptures, blood clots start to form, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. High cholesterol can cause reduced blood flow to the brain, pelvis, legs, arms, heart, or kidneys, and can also lead to conditions, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coronary heart disease<\/li>\n<li>Carotid artery disease<\/li>\n<li>Peripheral artery disease<\/li>\n<li>Chronic kidney disease<\/li>\n<li>Heart attack<\/li>\n<li>Stroke<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What causes high cholesterol?","accordion_intro":"<p>There are a number of factors that together contribute to causing high cholesterol.

This is called a lipid profile or panel.<\/p>\n<p>Your healthcare professional may suggest that you don\u2019t eat or drink anything except water for 8-12 hours prior to your bloodwork.
