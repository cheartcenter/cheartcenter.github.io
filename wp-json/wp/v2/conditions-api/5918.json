Your body\u2019s goal is to maintain healthy organ perfusion (the rate at which blood reaches tissue). So, if an organ isn\u2019t receiving enough blood, your body will send signals to increase blood pressure, and improve the perfusion.<\/p>\n<p>Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure is the result of too much resistance to blood flow through your arteries.<\/p>\n<p>When blood passes through your arteries, the more space it has to move, the less resistance it faces. When artery pathways become narrow, the resistance increases, causing your blood pressure to rise. This means that your body has to work harder to achieve the same healthy level of organ perfusion.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>There are two types of hypertension:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary &#8211; usually has no identifiable cause, develops over many years, and can be caused by multiple compounding factors (genetics, renal structure, function, etc).
