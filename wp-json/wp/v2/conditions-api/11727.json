It can be hard to get rid of because of the sheer number of mites present on the body. Most people with scabies have about 10-15 mites on their body at any given time. In cases of severe scabies, the number of mites on the body can be in the hundreds of thousands. Crusted scabies isn\u2019t usually as itchy, and in addition to the symptoms above, can include flaky skin on the face, and hair loss.

It is common for entire households to get scabies at once because of how contagious scabies is among people living in close quarters.<\/p>\n<p>If someone has crusted scabies, it\u2019s possible for another person to become infested by sleeping in their unwashed sheets, or borrowing their clothes.

Because the scabies rash imitates so many other things, it\u2019s easily misdiagnosed.<\/p>\n<p>A doctor can diagnose scabies by looking at your skin. They\u2019ll look for the burrows, or track marks, that distinguish scabies from other concerns.
