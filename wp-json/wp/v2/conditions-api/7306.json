This is normal, and is not usually noticeable because new hair is growing in at the same time to replace the ones that are lost. However, when it doesn&#8217;t grow back in, you may be experiencing alopecia symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Alopecia areata, also known as hair loss or simply alopecia, is a common autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Sometimes the hair grows back, but falls out again later. In other cases, the hair may never grow back, or grow back for good once it returns.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"<p>When hair is lost, it often comes out in clumps that are the size and shape of a quarter. The amount of hair loss is different in everyone, so signs of alopecia can appear very differently from person to person. Some may only lose a small amount of hair, while others may lose a lot or all of their hair. While hair loss most commonly affects the head, that isn\u2019t always the case. It can occur in all hair-bearing areas on your body including eyebrows, eye lashes, beards, and extremities.<\/p>\n<p>While alopecia areata is most common in its main form, there are a few different types of alopecia, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ophiasis alopecia areata &#8211; causes hair loss in the shape of a band around the sides and back of the head<\/li>\n<li>Alopecia areata totalis &#8211; total loss of hair on the head<\/li>\n<li>Alopecia areata universalis &#8211; total loss of hair on the body<\/li>\n<li>Diffuse alopecia areata &#8211; sudden thinning of hair, rather than lost patches<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the symptoms of alopecia?","accordion_intro":"<p>The main symptom or sign of alopecia is hair loss.
