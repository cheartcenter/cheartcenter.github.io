Occasional coughs are normal, and a healthy way for the body to clear irritants and secretions from your lungs.<br \/>\nCoughing is your body\u2019s reflex to stimuli (mechanical or chemical) in your upper and lower airways, pericardium, diaphragm, or stomach. Mechanical receptors are triggered by touch or displacement. Chemical receptors react to hot or cold acids, capsaicin-like compounds, and certain other chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>Often, coughs are signs or symptoms of other underlying conditions. Everyone will experience a cough at some point in their lives, and many conditions that cause coughs will pass on their own.<\/p>\n<p>If a cough becomes severe, lasts for more than two weeks, or brings up bloody or discolored mucus, it could be an indication of a more serious underlying condition.<\/p>\n<p>Chronic coughs are considered any cough that lasts for eight weeks or longer in adults, or four weeks in children.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordion","accordion_title":"What are the associated symptoms of a cough?","accordion_intro":"<p>Coughs are signs or symptoms of other underlying conditions, so they can be an indicator for a wide range of conditions.
