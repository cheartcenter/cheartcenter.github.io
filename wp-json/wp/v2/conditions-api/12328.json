However, this test isn\u2019t always accurate, as ordinary skin can occasionally be mistaken for warts.<\/p>\n<p>For genital warts in female patients, the doctor may suggest a pap test to help detect changes in the vaginal or cervical areas. Some forms of HPV, if left untreated, have been linked as a cause of cervical cancer in women.<\/p>\n<p>At this time there is no routine testing available for gay or bisexual men who are at a higher risk of anal cancer due to HPV. Some doctors are urging for anal PAPs to check for abnormalities, but at this time it is not approved in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In women over 30, the doctor may suggest an HPV test on the PAP smear. Although, due to the current Ontario Cervical Screening Guidelines, women under 30 aren\u2019t usually given this test.<\/p>\n<p>If the doctor wishes to do additional testing on the genital warts, they may request a biopsy.
