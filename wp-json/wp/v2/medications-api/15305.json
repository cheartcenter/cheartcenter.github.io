Aviane will not protect the user from STDs or STIs.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"},{"accordion_title":"How do you use Aviane?","accordion_intro":"<p>Aviane should be taken by mouth at the same time each day with or without food, as directed by a doctor.

Aviane comes in a 21-pack or 28-pack.<\/p>\n<p>21-day pack: Take the 21 active pills in order, daily. After taking the last active pill, do not take any tablets for 7 days unless otherwise directed by your doctor.<\/p>\n<p>28-day pack: Take the 21 active pills in order, daily.
