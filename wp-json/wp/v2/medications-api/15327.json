Typically, it is taken twice a day with or without food. Shake the bottle well before taking your dose and use the provided measuring cup to carefully measure your dose. Do not use a household spoon or chew the liquid suspension. It may bind with certain products, so take it 2 hours before or 6 hours after consuming those items.

Taking expired ciprofloxacin isn\u2019t dangerous, but it could lose some of its potency and may not be as effective. If your ciprofloxacin prescription has expired, take the remainder to any medication take-back program and talk to your doctor about a new prescription, if you believe it&#8217;s needed. Note: it\u2019s very important that you take your full course of antibiotics as instructed. Don\u2019t save the remainder of your prescription for your next illness if you begin to feel better part way through your course of medication.<\/p>\n","accordion_content":"","accordion_more_text":"See more","accordion_less_text":"See less"}]},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/medications-api\/15327"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/medications-api"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/mpl_medication"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15327"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
