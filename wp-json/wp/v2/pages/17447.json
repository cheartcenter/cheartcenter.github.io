Switch Health only provides testing for asymptomatic individuals.<\/p>\n<p>PCR tests detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus itself, indicating whether or not there is an active infection. Other tests only detect antibodies, which may indicate a previous infection.<\/p>\n<p>Switch Health offers real-time PCR tests. We work with our lab partners to provide you with quick results. You can expect to receive the results of your test on the same day or following day which you are tested.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What&#8217;s a PCR test?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. Tests like molecular polymerase chain reaction tests detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and are indicative of an existing infection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How long does it take to get my results?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Switch Health works with its partners to ensure fast turnarounds for our lab-based PCR tests. For patients in Ontario, test results are available the same day or the next day by midnight. For patients in Alberta and Nova Scotia, test results may be available the same day or as late as by midnight two full calendar days following testing. For example, if a patient is tested on Monday, they may not receive their results until Wednesday by midnight. <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Are your tests accepted for travel purposes?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes. COVID-19 testing via Switch Health is available to passengers travelling internationally that require a negative test. Switch Health is an active testing partner for numerous airlines around the globe and provides valid travel-related PCR lab certificates that are required by most destination countries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Where do the tests take place?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can schedule a test at one of these clinics in the Greater Toronto Area:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2251 Lawrence Ave E, Scarborough<\/li>\n<li>4230 Sherwoodtowne Blvd, Mississauga<\/li>\n<li>901 Eglinton Ave W, York<\/li>\n<li>82 Peter Street, Downtown Toronto<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Alberta:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>150, 625 11th Avenue SW, Calgary<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Nova Scotia:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1496 Lower Water St, Unit GH-426, Halifax<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How will I get my results?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You will receive your results via a secure portal. For patients in Ontario, test results are available the same day or the next day by midnight. For patients in Alberta and Nova Scotia, test results may be available the same day or as late as by midnight two full calendar days following testing. For example, if a patient is tested on Monday, they may not receive their results until Wednesday by midnight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What happens if my test result is positive?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>As soon as your results are in, you&#8217;ll receive a notification via a secure email link. If you have a positive test, you can schedule a consultation with your family doctor or a walk-in clinic for follow-up. Or, you can speak to a doctor on Maple to review your results.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Does a PCR test tell me if I was previously infected?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>No. PCR tests are designed to confirm a current, existing infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Where do you process your testing?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ontario and Alberta tests will be processed in the province in which you received testing. Nova Scotia tests are processed in Ontario.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Why do you charge for your tests?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic patients travelling internationally aren&#8217;t covered by the provincial government. To serve patients as quickly as possible, Switch Health provides independent COVID-19 testing solutions to travellers who require a negative COVID-19 test. Switch Health uses its own supply chains to take pressure off of the public health system.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What happens if I need to cancel my appointment?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patients can cancel or reschedule without a fee up until 24 hours before their appointment. Appointments cancelled within 24 hours will be charged 50% of the full fee. Missed appointments will be charged the full fee.<\/p>\n<!--SCHEMA-->\n<h2>\n\t\tSchedule an independent COVID-19 test today\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>In partnership with Switch Health, we offer COVID-19 tests for passengers who are travelling internationally and require a negative test.
