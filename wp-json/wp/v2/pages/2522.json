Psychotherapists use counselling, also known as talk therapy to facilitate personal change through self-knowledge, emotional acceptance and growth with the optimal development of personal resources.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What can an online psychotherapist treat?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Maple therapists can help with many things, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Exploring depression or low moods<\/li>\n<li>Discussing relationship challenges<\/li>\n<li>Addressing work stress<\/li>\n<li>Helping to navigate life changes<\/li>\n<li>Increasing focus, performance and motivation<\/li>\n<li>Exploring grief or loss<\/li>\n<li>&#8230; and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What should I expect in my consultation with a psychotherapist?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>During your first consultation, you&#8217;ll be able to select any topic you wish to discuss with the online therapist. Then, the therapist will gather information about you and your history to properly evaluate your concerns and arrive at a plan to help guide treatment. Each session will be 50 minutes in duration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What are the advantages of online counselling?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Online counselling allows you to see a psychotherapist from the comfort of your own home through video, phone call, or chat. You&#8217;re able to book a visit at a time that&#8217;s most convenient for you. Or, you can choose to speak with someone as soon as possible &#8211; you&#8217;ll hear back from the therapist directly in 12 hours or less.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Do Maple&#8217;s psychotherapists accept insurance?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many benefit programs cover the fee of consulting with an MSW RSW therapist or registered psychotherapists (RPs) &#8211; check with your benefits provider to see if this is something that&#8217;s available to you. The therapist&#8217;s license number and credentials will be on your Maple receipt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can a psychotherapist prescribe medications?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Psychotherapists are not able to prescribe any medications, as they are not medical doctors. Your treatment may consist of talk therapy, CBT and other communication-based methods.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can I see the same therapist every time?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes, in order to select the same psychotherapist, you&#8217;ll need to book an appointment and select the same psychotherapist each time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What is the difference between a psychiatrist, psychologist, and psychotherapist?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/providers\/psychiatry\/\">Psychiatrists<\/a> are medical doctors who specialize in mental health and psychiatric disorders. They undergo additional training and licensing so that they&#8217;re able to diagnose and treat mental illness. Psychiatrists focus on the physical causes of mental illness, as well as the mental health aspects, and can prescribe medications.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Psychologists and psychotherapists, however, are not medical doctors. Psychologists often focus on cognitive behaviour therapy and other behavioural strategies, while psychotherapists often focus on talk therapy. Psychologists and psychotherapists cannot prescribe medications.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/img_couch@2x.png\" alt=\"img_couch@2x\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"890\" width=\"998\" title=\"img_couch@2x\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<h2>Life can be hard.
