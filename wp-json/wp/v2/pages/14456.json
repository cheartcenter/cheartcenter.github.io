Doctors can prescribe you refills at their discretion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How do online prescriptions work?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Similar to in-person visits, you&#8217;ll have a consultation with the doctor, and they&#8217;ll determine whether they can give you a prescription on Maple. The prescription itself will be digital (instead of paper), and you can send it directly to a pharmacy right from the app. We&#8217;ll contact you as soon as the pharmacy has your medication ready.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You also have the option to get it delivered right to your door at no additional cost. We&#8217;re collaborating with partner pharmacies to offer convenient, reliable prescription deliveries across Canada.<\/p>\n<p>For more details regarding delivery, click <a href=\"http:\/\/helpdesk.getmaple.ca\/en\/articles\/830056-how-does-the-prescription-delivery-service-work\">here<\/a>. If you don&#8217;t need delivery, you can simply pick up your medications from the pharmacy of your choice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can my prescriptions be mailed?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes! Delivery is available for all prescriptions within 2-5 business days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can I order a prescription online?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can use Maple to have an online consultation with a doctor and get a prescription based on your needs, at their discretion. From there, you&#8217;ll need to send your prescription to a pharmacy so you can obtain your medication. We&#8217;ll notify you as soon as the pharmacy has your medication so you can go and pick it up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can online doctors write prescriptions?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes! Doctors on Maple can prescribe most common medications, with the exception of controlled medications like narcotics.<\/p>\n<p>Prescriptions are given at the doctor&#8217;s discretion and can be faxed directly to the pharmacy of your choice or even delivered right to your door.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can I purchase my prescriptions online?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re using Maple and the doctor gives you a prescription, it&#8217;s included in the consultation. However, you&#8217;ll need to pay for the medications at the pharmacy, the same way you would if you got a prescription from a doctor&#8217;s office in person. Your employer or insurer may cover some of these costs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What kind of medications can online doctors prescribe?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Doctors can prescribe most medications online for most ailments.
