A weight management consultant is a trained weight management nurse practitioner who can provide weight management services and give you the support and tools to help you manage your weight and reach your goals.<\/p>\n<p>Weight management consultants can help you with many things, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring your regular habits and goals.<\/li>\n<li>Discussing your intrinsic motivation, challenges, adherence, and conviction.<\/li>\n<li>Addressing obstacles.<\/li>\n<li>Assessing your eligibility for weight loss prescription therapy.<\/li>\n<li>Guiding you in your weight loss journey.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What should I expect for my initial consultation with a weight management consultant?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>During your initial consultation, the consultant will ask you questions about you and your history to properly evaluate your weight concerns. Your individual profile will help guide your weight management plan. The consultant will work with you to determine which weight management approach would be best for your needs and if you&#8217;re a potential candidate for prescription therapy. Initial sessions are 45 minutes in duration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What are the advantages of an online weight management consultation?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Online consultations allow you to see a weight management consultant from anywhere, including the comfort of your own home, through audio or video. You can schedule a visit at a time that&#8217;s convenient for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Is this program covered by public health insurance like OHIP?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the moment, no. Initial consultations are $150 and 45 minutes in length. You can also book 15-minute follow-up appointments for $75 after your initial consultation. Fees can sometimes be covered by benefit programs, so check with your insurance provider.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Am I eligible for weight-loss medication therapy?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Prescription weight-loss medication may be able to help some people who haven&#8217;t been able to lose weight through diet and exercise. That being said, they are not appropriate for everyone. Our providers will consider your individual profile and history when determining which treatment approach would be best for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Medication is usually prescribed only if your BMI is 30 or higher, or if it&#8217;s at least 27 and you have a condition that may be related to your weight, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. You must be 18 years old or older, and not pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Do you prescribe weight-loss medication and are weight-loss medications covered by insurance?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the weight management consultant believes medication is appropriate for you, they can write you a prescription. Though costs vary, weight-loss medications tend to be expensive. Some, though not all, insurance plans cover medications that treat people who are overweight or obese. If a provider has recommended weight-loss medication, talk to your pharmacist about how much you will have to pay and ask them to check your coverage if you have insurance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What medications options are available?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave) and Liraglutide (Saxenda) can both be prescribed on Maple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How effective are weight-loss drugs and how much weight can I lose?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Prescription weight-loss drugs approved for long-term use (more than 12 weeks) produce significant weight loss compared with a placebo. The combination of weight-loss medication and lifestyle changes results in greater weight loss than lifestyle changes do alone.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of a year, that can mean a weight loss of 3% to 7% of total body weight in addition to what can be achieved with lifestyle changes. That may seem like a modest amount, but a sustained weight loss of 5% to 10% can have important health benefits, such as lowering blood pressure, blood sugar, and triglyceride levels.<\/p>\n<!--SCHEMA-->\n<h2>\n\t\tTalk to a weight management consultant online\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>Excess weight can have serious health impacts.
