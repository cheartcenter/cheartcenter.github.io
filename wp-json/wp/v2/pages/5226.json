It\u2019s usually the result of stress or a traumatic event. Other people have long-term or chronic insomnia that lasts for a month or more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Symptoms of insomnia include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty falling asleep at night<\/li>\n<li>Waking up during the night<\/li>\n<li>Waking up too early<\/li>\n<li>Not feeling well-rested after a night\u2019s sleep<\/li>\n<li>Daytime sleepiness<\/li>\n<li>Irritability<\/li>\n<li>Depression or anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty paying attention or focusing on tasks<\/li>\n<li>Increased errors or accidents<\/li>\n<li>Ongoing worries about sleep<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your insomnia is making it difficult for you to function throughout the day, a sleep therapist may be able to help.

It usually begins with a review of your sleeping habits, daytime sleepiness, and other important factors that might be influencing your sleep routine. A sleep study may be necessary if the cause of your insomnia remains unclear after preliminary tests, or if you are showing signs of another sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How is insomnia treated?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In many cases, simple changes to your sleep habits and CBT-I can ease you back into a healthy sleep cycle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can consult with highly skilled sleep therapists, trained in the delivery of CBT-I from the comfort of your home on Maple.
