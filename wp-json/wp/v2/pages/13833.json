An allergist is a physician who&#8217;s been trained to diagnose, treat, and manage allergies.<\/p>\n<p>Becoming an allergist requires four years of medical school, three years in a residency program, followed by a two year clinical immunology and allergy fellowship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Who should be seen by an allergist? <\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Allergies can be sudden, acute attacks, or they can manifest as feeling sick for months on end. It&#8217;s estimated that 10-15% of Canadians have seasonal allergies, while millions more have sensitivities to different foods, textiles, drugs, pet hair, and so on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Usually, patients see their family doctor first to discuss symptoms or persistent illness. If you&#8217;re unable to see your family doctor or receive a referral for an allergist and clinical immunologist, Maple can connect you with these essential physicians online so you can start feeling better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can children see an allergist online?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes, our allergists can treat children. Simply add your child as a &#8220;Patient profile&#8221; in your Maple account. Then, select your child or dependent&#8217;s profile when booking an appointment with the allergist.\u00a0<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What should I expect during my consultation?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your allergist will begin by inquiring about your medical history. They&#8217;ll also ask if you&#8217;ve had any acute allergic episodes, such as anaphylaxis.<\/p>\n<p>Then, your allergist may order tests to determine your sensitivities. Typical allergy testing looks for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drug allergies<\/li>\n<li>Food allergies<\/li>\n<li>Insect allergies<\/li>\n<li>Latex allergies<\/li>\n<li>Mould allergies<\/li>\n<li>Pet allergies<\/li>\n<li>Pollen allergies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How can I get follow-up tests?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For patients in Ontario, our allergist in Ontario offers allergy and sensitivity testing at her Toronto and Guelph clinics. Skin testing ordered during your appointment must be performed by the same allergist. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll need a referral from a family doctor to receive skin testing from another allergist.<\/p>\n<p>Blood tests ordered during your appointment can be carried out at any clinic.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For patients in Ontario, some tests may be covered by OHIP, while other tests require an extra charge. The allergist will provide further explanation of tests recommended for you.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that it&#8217;s up to the physician&#8217;s discretion as to whether tests are ordered for any patient.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What is the best method for testing allergies?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This depends on the patient&#8217;s health history, and in some cases a physical exam. Skin tests are preferred because they offer immediate results, are highly sensitive, and are less expensive than other methods. Blood tests may be used if skin testing is not appropriate or available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What are allergy injections and why are they prescribed?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Allergy injections are a form of immunotherapy. The allergen exposure is closely regulated and given on a scheduled basis in order to build an immune response to the allergen. They are often recommended when a patient experiences severe symptoms to a specific allergen which is not avoidable (i.e. grass pollen).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/maple-allergist-web_footer_banner-image.jpg\" alt=\"maple-allergist-web_footer_banner-image\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"630\" width=\"708\" title=\"maple-allergist-web_footer_banner-image\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<h2>Live life without hesitations.<\/h2>\n<p>Speak to our allergists online.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/register\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Get started now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet started now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t<h2>Testimonials<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/star_filled-svg.png\" alt=\"star_filled-svg\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"52\" width=\"294\" title=\"star_filled-svg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>&#8220;Noelle is most deserving of my gratefulness for her guidance with my lifestyle medical health plan.

I am so grateful to Noelle for guiding me as to how to go about getting this medication out of my system. Just want to let you know how much better I am as I am continuing to wean myself off a medication that had too many negative effects on me. I am almost completely off it and I have never felt so good to know this was possible; it feels like the curtain has risen on me and I am back to the person I was before this medication took over my life for the worse.

Unlike my other practitioners (I&#8217;ve had many) she is very patient and always follows up with me to make sure that I capture all the information I need to make informed health decisions for myself. I was getting the best information possible. Perhaps the most important has been that there are tests to help identify the things that have been causing issues and that there are programs aimed for treating them. I feel better than I&#8217;ve felt in a very long time. I have had increased energy and an improved disposition. I simply cannot say enough. Noelle keep up with all you do.
