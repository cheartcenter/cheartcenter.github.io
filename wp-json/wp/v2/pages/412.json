These Terms also govern participation in Maple\u2019s Referral Program, Gift Card Program, and the Purchasing Credit Program (collectively &#8220;Maple Programs&#8221;). For clarity, these Terms set out circumstances in which you may use the Maple Platform on behalf of another individual, and where you are doing so (as permitted), references to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d in these Terms include the child or other individual listed in your account for whom you have the legal authority to seek Healthcare Services as defined below (each a \u201cRegistered Dependent\u201c).<\/p>\n<p>By accessing and using the Maple Platform, or participating in any Maple Programs, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms, which establish a contractual relationship between you and Maple. If you do not agree to these Terms at any point, you must immediately cease accessing the Maple Platform and participating in any Maple Programs.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, alter or otherwise update these Terms at any time and, by using the Maple Platform or participating in any Programs, after the amendment of the Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by such modifications, alterations or updates. The date on which these Terms were last amended will appear at the top.<\/p>\n<p>On notice to you, Maple may immediately terminate these Terms and\/or any Maple Programs, and\/or access to the Maple Platform or participation in any Maple Programs, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Maple Platform or any portion thereof and\/or any Maple Programs, at any time, for any reason.<\/p>\n<h2>Authorized Physicians, Authorized Non-Physician Providers, Maple Telemedicine Platform<\/h2>\n<h3>Authorized Physicians<\/h3>\n<p>All physicians providing Healthcare Services or Informational Services, as defined below, (each an \u201cAuthorized Physician\u201d) are independent, regulated health professionals registered to practice medicine in a Province or Territory of Canada. Maple is not a healthcare provider. Authorized Physicians alone are responsible for the Healthcare Services and Informational Services they provide through the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by the law in the Province or Territory in which you reside, Authorized Physicians may be located in your Province or Territory or another Province or Territory of Canada. If you want information about any particular Authorized Physician, consult his or her profile on the register on the website of the medical regulator (in most Provinces, the \u201cCollege of Physicians and Surgeons\u201d of the Province), in the Province or Territory in which the Physician Practices.<\/p>\n<h3>Authorized Non-Physician Providers<\/h3>\n<p>All non-physician providers providing Healthcare Services or Informational Services, as defined below, (each an \u201cAuthorized Non-Physician Provider\u201d) are independent, regulated health professionals (such as psychotherapists or nurses) registered to provide healthcare in a Province or Territory of Canada. Maple is not a healthcare provider. Authorized Non-Physician Providers alone are responsible for the Healthcare Services and Informational Services they provide through the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by the law in the Province or Territory in which you reside, Authorized Non-Physician Providers may be located in your Province or Territory or another Province or Territory of Canada. If you want information about any particular Authorized Non-Physician Provider, consult his or her profile on the register on the website of the regulator (in most Provinces, named a \u201cCollege\u201d), in the Province or Territory in which the Non-Physician Provider Practices.<\/p>\n<h3>Services<\/h3>\n<p>Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers may provide two kinds of services through the Maple Platform: health care services (\u201cHealthcare Services\u201d) and\/or general information about diseases and conditions and how they are treated in Canada (\u201cInformational Services\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Telemedicine is the delivery of health care and other services using interactive text, audio and video technology, where the patient and the physician are not in the same physical location.\u00a0During your telemedicine consultation with an Authorized Physician or a Non-Physician Provider, you will be asked to provide the Authorized Physician or Non-Physician Provider certain\u00a0Personal Information including Personal Health Information (collectively referred to together as \u201cInformation\u201d). When discussing Healthcare Services, information typically refers to Personal Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d), and when discussing Informational Services, Information typically refers to information that is not specifically about you or your health, such as information in questions you would be comfortable asking of an expert during the call-in portion of a radio broadcast on health-related matters. PHI is not required for Informational services, and we advise you to not to submit PHI in the course of accessing Informational Services.<\/p>\n<p>The type of services that are available to you through the Maple Platform depends on your province of residence and the location you are in at the time you request the services. This is because telemedicine is regulated by the Provinces and Territories and the rules differ or may differ from time to time, among the Provinces and Territories.<\/p>\n1) Healthcare Services, Limits on Healthcare Services<br \/>\nHealthcare Services will only be made available to you if you are a temporary or permanent resident of a Canadian Province or Territory, whether or not physically in the Province or Territory at the time that you request the Healthcare Services (\u201cResidency Requirements\u201d). The relationship between you and an Authorized Physician providing Healthcare Services is a physician-patient relationship. Maple is not a party to that relationship. The relationship between you and an Authorized Non-Physician Provider providing Healthcare Services is a provider-patient relationship. Maple is not a party to that relationship.\n<p>There are restrictions on the Healthcare Services that can be provided through the Maple Platform. YOU MUST NOT USE THE MAPLE PLATFORM FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL NEEDS. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY OR ATTEND YOUR NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM.<\/p>\n<p>The following symptoms are specifically\u00a0excluded\u00a0from the Healthcare Services: chest pains, difficulty breathing, fever in children under the age of 3 months, blackouts or feeling like you may blackout, any impairment in level of consciousness, stroke like symptoms such as impaired sensation or paralysis to one side of your body, inability to speak or comprehend language, any abdominal pain severe enough that you are unable to comfortably walk.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the limitations set out above, Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers are not permitted to prescribe certain kinds of medication including narcotics, controlled substances or other types of controlled medications, non-therapeutic drugs and other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.<\/p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY PRESCRIPTIONS YOU ACQUIRE FROM AN AUTHORIZED PHYSICIAN OR AN AUTHORIZED NON-PHYSICIAN PROVIDER ARE SOLELY FOR THE PERSONAL USE OF THE INDIVIDUAL NAMED ON THE PRESCRIPTION. YOU AGREE TO FULLY AND CAREFULLY READ ALL PROVIDED PRODUCT INFORMATION AND LABELS, AND TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN OR PHARMACIST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRESCRIPTION OR MEDICATION.<\/p>\n<p>You should report any medication reactions, side effects or other adverse events to your family physician or, if you do not have one, to the nearest walk-in clinic or emergency room or call 911 if any reaction is an emergency situation. Do not report drug reactions, side effects or adverse events through the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<p>Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers have the discretion to refuse or discontinue the provision of Healthcare Services to any User at any time, including for actual or potential misuse of the Healthcare Services by a User.<\/p>\n<p>Not a Replacement for Primary Care.\u00a0Please note that interaction with an Authorized Physician through the Maple Platform is not intended to take the place of appointments with your regular primary care provider. If you do not have an established relationship with a primary care provider, you are encouraged to develop one. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by the Authorized Physician. We do not provide your family physician with a report about the Healthcare Services that you receive through the Maple Platform. So your family physician can take into consideration these Healthcare Services, including any prescriptions, it is always advisable that you advise your physician about the Healthcare Services you receive, including the issues that caused you to request them. As described below, the Maple Platform enables you to send a summary of your Healthcare Services to a physician of your choice.<\/p>\n<p>2) Informational Services. Limits on Informational Services<\/p>\n<p>Informational Services are available to you whether or not you meet the Residency Requirements. Informational Services are for general educational purposes only (similar to advice that might be provided by a 3rd party medical expert on a phone in radio show), and are not Healthcare Services. The information provided will be disease or condition specific rather than patient specific and will not include diagnosis or treatment. Maple is not a party to your relationship with an Authorized Physician or an Authorized Non-Physician Provider providing Informational Services.<\/p>\n<p>Informational Services do not replace consultations with qualified medical or other relevant healthcare professionals. You agree that you bear all risk associated with the use of or reliance on Informational Services, and release and hold Maple, Authorized Physicians, and Authorized Non-Physician Providers providing Informational Services harmless from and against any claim, demand, action, cause of action, damage, loss, cost, liability or expense, including reasonable legal fees, which may be made or brought against or incurred or suffered by Maple or an Authorized Physician, or an Authorized Non-Physician Provider directly or indirectly as a result of, in respect of, or arising out of your reliance on Informational Services.<\/p>\n<p>Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers have the discretion to refuse or discontinue the provision of some or all Informational Services to any User at any time, including for actual or potential misuse of the Informational Services by a User and where the information being requested is not general information but in the nature of a diagnosis or treatment.<\/p>\n<h2>Privacy<\/h2>\n<p>Our collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal and destruction of Information are governed by our Privacy Policy, located at www.getmaple.ca\/privacy. You must review our Privacy Policy prior to agreeing to these Terms as the Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into, and accordingly is part of, these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>By authorizing someone else (a \u201cThird Party\u201d) to pay the fees for your Healthcare Services or Informational Services, as described in the section on Payment below and to the extent permitted under the section on Third Party Payment below, you are representing to Maple, and Maple will rely on your representation, that:<\/p>\n<p>a. you consent to us using the email address provided to us by the Third Party to communicate with you regarding the Maple Platform and Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services;<\/p>\n<p>b. disclosing the information that you have requested Healthcare Services to the Third Party to permit Maple to process payment for the Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services; and<\/p>\n<p>c. notifying the Third Party of any changes or termination of your access to the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions about our privacy program, our management of your Information, or the personal information that we disclose to Third Party payers, please contact us as set out in the\u00a0<a href=\"..\/privacy\">Privacy Policy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How it Works<\/h2>\n<h3>The Maple Platform and Healthcare Services<\/h3>\n<p>The Maple Platform enables you to access the online provision of health care from healthcare providers who practice in one or more Provinces or Territories of Canada, for you. The Maple Platform and Healthcare Services will only be made available to you if you meet the Residency Requirements set out above, whether or not you are physically in your Province or Territory of residence at the time that you request Healthcare Services. By using the Maple Platform and Healthcare Services, you represent and warrant that you, or any Registered Dependent, meets the Residency Requirements at the time that the Healthcare Services are provided. You agree that the Maple Platform is made available solely for your personal and non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>The Maple Platform also enables you to: store\u00a0Information (including PHI created or compiled in the course of providing Healthcare Services) and to share it with Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers; and receive and store prescriptions and sick notes, among other documents, from Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers electronically. The Maple Platform offers optional services that Maple will perform on your behalf, at your direction, including the ability to: fax securely a summary report about your Healthcare Services to a physician of your choice; fax securely your prescription to your chosen pharmacy and receive notice when it is ready for pick-up; open an account for you with a prescription delivery service; and, where available, securely transmit your information to the prescription delivery service.<\/p>\n<h3>The Maple Platform and Informational Services<\/h3>\n<p>The Maple Platform enables you to access the online provision of general medical information from Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers. You acknowledge and agree that the Maple Platform and Informational Services are made available solely for your personal and non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<h2>For Clarity<\/h2>\n<p>BY REGISTERING TO USE THE MAPLE PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT:<\/p>\n1. The Maple Platform is a technology platform that facilitates connecting Users (and any individuals for whom they have created a profile in their User Account) with Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers for the provision of Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services, that Maple is not a party to the relationship between you and any Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Providers providing Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services. Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers are independent contractors who are not employed by Maple or otherwise affiliated with Maple.<br \/>\n2. AUTHORIZED PHYSICIANS AND AUTHORIZED NON-PHYSICIAN PROVIDERS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND INFORMATIONAL SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO YOU, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS OF CARE AND RECORD-KEEPING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS.<br \/>\n3. As with any other medical consultation, no results can be guaranteed or assured: your Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider may determine that Healthcare Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide Healthcare Services to you through the Maple Platform.<br \/>\n4. As with any other health care service, there are risks associated with the use of the Healthcare Services.<br \/>\n5. There are risks associated with any inappropriate reliance on Informational Services.<br \/>\n6. The Maple Platform may not permit the transmission of information in a way that allows the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider to provide Healthcare Services or Informational Services (e.g., poor resolution of images).<br \/>\n7. You are responsible for providing the Authorized Physician and Authorized Non-Physician Provider with the information that he or she advises is required in order to provide you with Healthcare Services or Informational Services.<br \/>\n8. The laws that protect the privacy and security of PHI apply to telemedicine; (again, please see our\u00a0Privacy Policy).<br \/>\n9. The content and material appearing on the Maple Platform could include technical, typographical or photographic errors. Maple does not warrant that any of the materials provided are accurate or current (see the Section on \u201cContent\u201d below).\n<h2>Content<\/h2>\n<p>None of the information or materials (collectively, excluding Healthcare Services, (\u201cContent\u201d) available through the Maple Platform is medical advice, treatment, diagnosis or an endorsement, representation or warranty that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate, or effective for you. Content is for informational purposes only.\u00a0 It is your responsibility to discuss any Content with your family physician or another healthcare provider prior to relying on it and any reliance on Content is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<h2>Ownership<\/h2>\n<p>The Maple Platform, all Contents and rights therein, except PHI, are and shall remain Maple\u2019s property or the property of Maple\u2019s licensors.

You must be at least 18 years of age to create a User Account, unless you are associated with a Third Party that permits individuals under the age of 18 to create a User Account (e.g. such as an international student in Canada associated with a specific insurance provider that is paying Fees on your behalf) and you meet the Third Party minimum age requirement specified to you in any additional terms at the time you create the User Account. You are only permitted to request Healthcare Services for you or for Registered Dependents you have added to your User Account. You must create a separate \u201cprofile\u201d for each Registered Dependent, which will include the person\u2019s name and other personal information. Again, you are only permitted to request Healthcare Services for yourself or Registered Dependents. You may request Informational Services for you only.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your User Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your User Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Maple in writing, you may only possess one User Account.<\/p>\n<h2>Restrictions<\/h2>\n<p>While using the Maple Platform, you may not, and represent and promise that you will not:<\/p>\n1.

You agree that you will not contact Authorized Physicians\u00a0and Authorized Non-Physician Providers\u00a0in respect of Healthcare Services or Informational Services\u00a0except through the Maple Platform. For clarity, Maple has no interest in or control over any interaction that you may have with Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers outside the Maple Platform and unrelated to Healthcare Services or Informational Services.<\/p>\n<h2>Termination<\/h2>\n<p>As set out above, Maple reserves the right to terminate any User\u2019s access or use of the Maple Platform at any time, for any reason. If your User Account is terminated, Maple will have no further obligation to provide access to the Maple Platform, except to the extent there is an obligation to provide you with access to your Information, or we are requested to do so, for a limited period, by an Authorized Physician or an Authorized Non-Physician Provider in connection with his or her professional obligations to you.<\/p>\n<p>You may deactivate your User Account at any time, for any reason, by logging in to your User Account at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/login\">https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/login<\/a>. Please see our\u00a0Privacy Policy\u00a0in relation to our management of Information\u00a0on the deactivation of a User Account.<\/p>\n<h2>Fees\/Physician Payment\/ Payment Options<\/h2>\n<p>Like certain other health professional services, Healthcare Services are provided for a fee. The fees for Healthcare Services are only for those elements of Healthcare Services not covered by the provincial health plan in your Province or Territory of residence. We do not charge for services that are covered by provincial health plans. Where you have questions about fees charged for Healthcare Services, please contact us.<\/p>\n<p>You understand that you will be charged a fee for any Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services you receive from an Authorized Physician and\/or an Authorized Non-Physician Provider, unless the fees are paid by someone else (e.g. your employer) as permitted under these Terms. There are two options available for payment: pay-per-visit or membership. These options are described below.<\/p>\n<p>We charge Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers a service fee for using the Maple Platform which we deduct from the fees paid for Healthcare Services and Informational Services. Maple facilitates payment of the fees to the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider. Payment of the fees through the credit card validation and processing arrangement described below shall be considered the same as payment made directly to the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider. All fees for Healthcare Services and Informational Services are in Canadian dollars and inclusive of all applicable taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Pay-per-visit option: You may pay the fees for Healthcare Services and Informational Services (\u201cFees\u201d) at the time you request Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services. Maple requires you to submit credit card information prior to any Healthcare Services or Informational Services being provided to you for the purpose of validation of the card. You will not be able to begin accessing Healthcare Services or Informational Services through the Maple Platform if the credit card information you provide is inaccurate and\/or if your credit card is declined at the point of validation. You agree that Maple, on behalf of Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers, may validate your credit card and put a hold on it in the amount of the Fees. Maple will notify you of any applicable Fees and will only have the charge processed to your credit card after you have obtained the corresponding Healthcare Services or Informational Services. Maple will provide you with a receipt for the Fees you pay.<\/p>\n<p>Membership option: Maple may allow you to purchase access to\u00a0certain\u00a0specified Healthcare Services or Informational Services during a fixed membership term for a flat fee (\u201cMembership Fee\u201d). Maple will notify you of the applicable Membership Fee and the Healthcare Services and Informational Services that are covered by the Membership Fee in any given year, and will have the Membership Fee processed to your credit card before the first time you obtain Healthcare Services or Informational Services under your membership. For the duration of your membership, you will not be charged additional fees for any Healthcare Services or Informational Services covered by your membership. The only additional fees would be for Healthcare Services or Informational Services you request that are outside of your membership and accordingly not covered by your Membership Fee. For access to Healthcare Services or Informational Services not covered by your membership, you must use the pay-per-visit-option. Your membership will automatically renew until cancelled by you in the Billing section of your Account Settings. In the event of an increase in the Membership Fee, we will notify you in advance, and ask whether you want to continue your membership. Your Membership Fees are\u00a0non-refundable, except where Maple terminates your access to the Maple Platform, in which case Maple will give you a pro rata refund of your Membership Fee. For clarity, Maple will refund the portion of your Membership Fee corresponding to the number of months remaining on your membership on the date of termination.<\/p>\n<h2>Third Party Payment\/Coverage<\/h2>\n<p>Maple may permit a Third Party (e.g. employer) to pay the Fees and\/or Membership Fees for some or all of the Healthcare Services or Informational Services provided to a User or group of Users. In these circumstances, Maple has a contract with the Third Party, under which the Third Party discloses the name and contact information, including the email address, of the User or Users who have agreed to register with Maple to obtain Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services, and for whom the Third Party will pay the Fees or Membership Fees for some or all of the Healthcare Services or Informational Services they receive. The payment option will be determined by the Third Party and Maple. Maple is not a party to and has no control over the agreement between any User and a Third Party payer. Coverage by a Third Party does not release a User from the obligation to comply with these Terms except the Terms related to his or her direct payment of the Fees or Membership Fees. Maple will inform Users of any changes to or termination of their Third Party coverage. Users whose Third Party coverage is terminated may be given the option of continuing to use the Maple Platform under their existing account so long as they pay the Fees or Membership Fees.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"referral\"><\/a>Maple Referral Program, Maple Purchasing Credit Program, Maple Gift Card Program<\/h2>\n<p>The Maple Referral Program allows Users to earn credits towards future Fees (\u201cMaple Referral Credits\u201d) by referring friends to Maple.\u00a0Credits can also be purchased in exchange for cash directly through the Maple Platform as part of the Maple Purchasing Credit Program (\u201cMaple Cash Credits\u201c).<\/p>\n<p>How to earn Maple Referral Credits: Users can earn Maple Referral Credits if: (i) a referred friend clicks on their referral link to create a valid Maple account; and (ii) the referred friend provides and verifies their email address and phone number as part of the Maple registration process. The referring User will be credited with Maple Referral Credits in the amount described in the Credits section in the User\u2019s Maple Account Settings. There is no maximum amount of credits a User can earn.<\/p>\n<p>Redeeming Maple Referral Credits and Maple Cash Credits: Maple Referral Credits and Maple Cash Credits will automatically appear as a coupon on the checkout page at any time Fees are due for Healthcare Services and\/or Information Services. Maple Referral Credits must be used within 24 months from the date they are issued. After 24 months, the Maple Referral Credits will expire. Maple Cash Credits do not expire. Maple Referral Credits and Maple Cash Credits may not be transferred or exchanged for any cash or money. Maple Referral Credits may not be earned by creating multiple Maple accounts. Maple Referral Credits and\/or Maple Cash Credits accrued in separate Maple accounts may not be combined into one Maple account.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing referral links: Referrals should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes, and only shared with personal connections that will appreciate receiving these invitations. Referral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the recipients are personal friends. The Maple referral process does not send an electronic message from an electronic address.<\/p>\n<p>Referred friends: Referred friends that have created a Maple account using a valid referral link will also receive Maple Referral Credits towards Fees. The standard Maple referral credit is $5.00 (five Canadian dollars), but may vary in some cases, for example if the referred friend signed up as part of a special promotion. The applicable credit amounts and additional terms and conditions will be provided in the referral invitation or accompanying materials.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple referrals: A referred friend may only use one referral link. If a referred friend receives referral links from multiple Users, only the User who sent the referral link used by the referred friend will receive Maple Referral Credits.<\/p>\n<p>Termination and Change: Maple may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or a User\u2019s or referred friend\u2019s participation and\/or right to participate in the Referral Program at any time for any reason. We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove Maple Referral Credits if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent. Maple has the right but not the obligation to monitor referral activities, and to suspend accounts or modify referrals as deemed fair and appropriate. Maple accepts no liability as a result of either monitoring or not monitoring referral activities.<\/p>\n<p>Disclaimer<\/p>\n<p>THE MAPLE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE.\u201d MAPLE DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, NOT EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

and Maple Medical Group is solely responsible for all billings and collections from patients and other consumers, and Maple shall have no liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any amounts owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.<\/p>\n<p>Maple does not provide any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way regarding any legal or medical issues associated with Provider, goods or services offered by Provider, including but not limited any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations.\u00a0 Provider should seek legal counsel regarding any legal and compliance issues, and should not rely on any materials or content associated with the Services in determining Provider\u2019s compliance obligations under law.\u00a0 Provider and Maple agree that Maple is not providing, to Customer or anyone else, medical advice or legal advice.<\/p>\n<p>Provider will use the Site and Services only in accordance with applicable standards of good medical practice.\u00a0 While software products such as the Site and Services can facilitate and improve the quality of service that Provider can offer patients, many factors, including the provider\/patient relationship can affect a patient outcome, and with intricate and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making it is often difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in what proportion they affected an outcome.\u00a0 Provider shall be solely responsible for its use of the Site and Services, and the provision of medical services to Provider\u2019s patients.\u00a0 In this regard, Provider releases Maple and waives any and all potential claims against Maple as a result of Provider\u2019s use of the Site and Services, and the provision of services to Provider\u2019s patients.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the patient care process, Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Maple harmless from any claim by or on behalf of any patient of Provider, or by or on behalf of any other third party or person claiming damage by virtue of a familial or financial relationship with such a patient, which is brought against Maple, regardless of the cause if such claim arises for any reason whatsoever, out of Provider\u2019s use or operation of the Site and Services.\u00a0 To the extent applicable, Provider will obtain Maple\u2019s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which Provider agrees to any finding of fault of Maple or defect in the Site or Services.\u00a0 Maple will promptly notify Provider in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly provide Provider with the information reasonably required for the defense of the same, and grant to Provider exclusive control over its defense and settlement.<\/p>\n<p>If you submit, upload, transmit, or post any consents, notices, advice, recommendations, comments, files, videos, images or other materials to us or our Site (\u201cProvider Content\u201d) or provide any Provider Content to patients or other consumers, you agree not to provide any Provider Content that (1) is defamatory, abusive, libelous, unlawful, obscene, threatening, harassing, fraudulent, pornographic, or harmful, or that could encourage criminal or unethical behavior, (2) violates or infringes the privacy, copyright, trademark, trade dress, trade secrets or intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or (3) contains or transmits a virus or any other harmful component.\u00a0 Provider is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary agreements and consents from, and providing all required notices to, patients and other consumers.\u00a0 You agree not to contact other users through unsolicited e-mail, telephone calls, mailings or any other method of communication.\u00a0 You represent and warrant to Maple that you have the legal right and authorization to upload all Provider Content at the Site.\u00a0 Maple shall have a royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable right and license to use the Provider Content however Maple desires, including without limitation, to copy, modify, delete in its entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from and\/or sell and\/or distribute such Provider Content and\/or incorporate such Provider Content into any form, medium or technology throughout the world. Maple is and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any Provider Content in confidence; (2) to pay to you any compensation for any Provider Content; or (3) to respond to any Provider Content.<\/p>\n<p>Maple does not regularly review Provider Content, but does reserve the right (but not the obligation) to monitor and edit or remove any Provider Content submitted to the Site.\u00a0 You grant Maple the right to use the name that you submit in connection with any Provider Content. You agree not to use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any Provider Content.\u00a0 You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Provider Content you post to the Site or provide to patients or other consumers.\u00a0 Maple and its affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Provider Content submitted by you or any third party.<\/p>\n<h3>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement<\/h3>\n<p>We will try work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with Site, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department.\u00a0 However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer\u2019s satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>You and Maple agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Site, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court.\u00a0 Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\u00a0 Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim.\u00a0 Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court.\u00a0 You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Maple are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\u00a0 This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual relationship between you and Maple.<\/p>\n<p>If you desire to assert a claim against Maple, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Maple, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (\u201cNotice\u201d).\u00a0 The Notice to Maple should be addressed to: 355 Adelaide Street West, Suite 100, Toronto, ON, Canada M5V 1S2 (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\u00a0 If Maple desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.\u00a0 A Notice, whether sent by you or by Maple, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\u00a0 If Maple and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Maple may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.\u00a0 During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Maple or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\u00a0 You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at www.adr.org.\u00a0 If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Maple receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US $10,000.\u00a0 The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.\u00a0 The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them from us by writing to us at the Notice Address.\u00a0 The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Use.\u00a0 All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of these Terms of Use, including this arbitration agreement.\u00a0 Unless Maple and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. (If you reside outside of the United States, any arbitration hearings will take place in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you, but will remain subject to the AAA Rules including the AAA rules regarding the selection of an arbitrator).\u00a0 If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\u00a0 If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\u00a0 Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\u00a0 If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Maple\u2019s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Maple did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Maple will pay you the amount of the award or US $1,000, whichever is greater.\u00a0 Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\u00a0 Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, if any.\u00a0 However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for payment or recovery attorneys\u2019 fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.<\/p>\n<p>YOU AND MAPLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\u00a0 Further, unless both you and Maple agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\u00a0 The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.<\/p>\n<p>If this Agreement to Arbitrate provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located in and for Hillsborough County, Florida.<\/p>\n<h3>Force Majeure<\/h3>\n<p>We will not be deemed to be in breach of these terms or liable for any breach of these terms or our privacy policy due to any event or occurrence beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, terrorism, war, invasion, failures of any public networks, electrical shortages, earthquakes or floods, civil disorder, strikes, fire or other disaster.<\/p>\n<h3>Indemnification<\/h3>\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Maple, Maple Medical Group, and any affiliates from and against any and all rights, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, causes of action, actions, and suits (no matter whether at law or equity), fees, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with: (i) your use or misuse of the Site, Products or Services or any information posted on the Site; (ii) your breach of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; (iii) the content or subject matter of any information you provide to Maple, Maple Medical Group, or any Provider or customer service agent; and\/or (iv) any negligent or wrongful act or omission by you in your use or misuse of the Site, Products or Services or any information on the Site, including without limitation, infringement of third party intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or negligent or wrongful conduct.<\/p>\n<h3>Revisions; General<\/h3>\n<p>Maple reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of this Site, with or without cause, and with or without notice.\u00a0 Maple reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use at any time, effective upon posting.\u00a0 Any use of this website after such changes will be deemed an acceptance of those changes.\u00a0 You agree to review the Terms of Use each time you access this website so that you may be aware of any changes to these Terms.\u00a0 In the event that any of the Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.\u00a0 These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Maple and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof.\u00a0 In its sole discretion, Maple may from time-to-time revise these Terms of Use by updating this posting.\u00a0 You should, therefore, periodically visit this page to review the current Terms of Use, so you are aware of any such revisions to which you are bound.\u00a0 Certain provisions of these Terms of Use may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages within this Site.<\/p>\n<p>Copyright\/Trademark Information.
