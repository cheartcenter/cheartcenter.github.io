Please note that we&#8217;re not able to guarantee that the doctor will order any specific tests.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What lab tests can be ordered online?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Our doctors can order diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasounds and x-rays, and tests for everything from iron levels to sexual health labs to confirm diagnosis. Please note that lab tests ordered will be at the doctor&#8217;s discretion based on your case.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How do online lab test requisitions work?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>During your visit, your doctor will determine if you need further testing and will give you a requisition form for the tests. You can then print the form and take it to any lab that&#8217;s convenient for you.<\/p>\n<p>The results will be sent to your Maple account and you can either download them and take them to your own doctor, or request another online visit for a Maple doctor to review the results with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How long does it take to get blood test results?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The time to receive test results can vary from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. You can ask the lab for specific timing of your specific lab tests.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can Maple doctors help me analyze my lab results?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Absolutely!
