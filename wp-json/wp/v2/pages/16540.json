This includes everyday tasks like brushing your teeth, climbing stairs, getting dressed, playing sports, and engaging in social activities. OTs often work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, schools, corporate companies, and people\u2019s homes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Occupational therapists are regulated healthcare professionals. Becoming an occupational therapist typically requires six to seven years of schooling, which includes an undergraduate degree, a Masters Program, and a provincial certification exam.<\/p>\r\n<p>All OTs on Maple are licensed in Canada.<\/p>\r\n<p><button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button><\/p>\r\n<h6>Are cognitive assessments available for everyone?<\/h6>\r\n<p>Yes. Cognitive assessments are available to anyone, including healthy individuals who would like to have a baseline assessment completed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Several medical conditions can also cause someone to seek a functional cognitive assessment. These include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Concussion<\/li>\r\n<li>Head injury<\/li>\r\n<li>Motor vehicle accident<\/li>\r\n<li>Neurological disorder<\/li>\r\n<li>Early or suspected dementia<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h6>Can a cognitive assessment serve as a capacity assessment?<\/h6>\r\n<p>No. Although this assessment can provide useful information and insight that may indicate that someone requires a capacity assessment, it cannot replace a formal capacity assessment. This type of evaluation assesses a person\u2019s mental capacity to determine if they can make decisions around property and personal care.<\/p>\r\n<h6>Will the occupational therapist provide a specific treatment plan during the initial assessment visit?<\/h6>\r\n<p>No. The occupational therapist will complete a report within 48 hours of your assessment and will provide you with a summary of their findings and recommendations for the next steps. You can discuss the summary of your assessment with your primary healthcare provider. If you\u2019d like to talk about your assessment in further detail or explore your occupational therapist\u2019s recommendations, a follow-up visit may be required.<\/p>\r\n<h6>What can I expect for a follow-up visit?<\/h6>\r\n<p>During the follow-up visit, your occupational therapist can take you through your assessment results in further detail, review recommendations, and provide education about brain health education with self-directed strategies to help you with challenges you\u2019re facing.<\/p>\r\n<h6>Is the cognitive assessment the same test as a MoCA?<\/h6>\r\n<p>No. MoCA stands for Montreal Cognitive Assessment. This test is most often used to screen for and assess dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, or related conditions. Both tests assess cognitive function, but the assessment itself is different.<\/p>\r\n<h6>What do I need to do to prepare for the cognitive assessment?<\/h6>\r\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re in a quiet, distraction-free space and have a piece of paper and a pen or pencil with you.<\/p>\r\n<!--SCHEMA-->\r\n<h2>Schedule a virtual cognitive assessment with an occupational therapist.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Get a functional cognitive assessment online that evaluates 25 key cognitive skills, including attention, communication, and memory.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.getmaple.ca\/register\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Get started <\/a> <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ill_walk\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/ill_walk.png\" alt=\"ill_walk\" width=\"754\" height=\"628\" \/><\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to know more about your brain function?
