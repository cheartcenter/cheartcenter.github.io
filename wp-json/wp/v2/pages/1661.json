The words and phrases used in this Policy have the same meaning as in Maple\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/terms\">Terms of Use<\/a>. You can also find a list of definitions at the bottom of this Policy or if you still have questions, contact our Chief Compliance Officer as indicated below.<\/p>\n<p>Maple Corporation (\u201cMaple\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d) uses a number of safeguards to protect the privacy of Users of the Maple Platform and the confidentiality of their Personal Information including Personal Health Information (collectively referred to together in this Privacy Policy as \u201cInformation\u201d). When discussing Healthcare Services, Information typically refers to Personal Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d), and when discussing Informational Services, Information typically refers to information that is not specifically about you or your health, such as information in questions you would be comfortable asking of an expert during the call-in portion of a radio broadcast on health-related matters. PHI is not required for Informational services, and we advise you to not to submit PHI in the course of accessing Informational Services.<\/p>\n<p>The agreement between Maple and physicians providing services through the Maple Platform, (Maple Physician Services Agreement) and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/terms\">Terms of Use<\/a>\u00a0for the Maple Platform explain the services that Maple provides to Authorized Physicians and to Users respectively. The agreement between Maple and Non-Physician Providers providing services through the Maple Platform, (e.g. Maple Therapist Services Agreement) explain the services that Maple provides to Authorized Non-Physician Providers.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) summarizes how Maple collects, uses, discloses, retains, disposes of, destroys and protects Information as well as Data (information that does not identify an individual) in the course of providing our services. We are committed to complying with this Policy and with applicable Provincial and Federal privacy legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this Policy does not apply to the collection, use, retention, disposal, destruction, and protection of Information by Authorized Physicians or Authorized Non-Physician Providers. Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers are subject to privacy legislation and professional requirements that govern their management of Information, including Information they collect, use and retain in the course of providing services through the Maple Platform. Please feel free to ask any Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider to whom you are referred if you have questions about how he or she will treat your Information.<\/p>\n<h3>Collecting and using\u00a0Information<\/h3>\n<p>Maple collects and uses Information only as necessary to provide our services, including to develop, assess, and improve our services. We only collect Personal Information if non-identifying information will not suffice. We minimize our collection and use of Information to what is needed for these purposes. For example, we do not record the audio or video portions of interactions between Users and Authorized Physicians and between Users and Authorized Non-Physician Providers through the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers are responsible for their collection, use, disclosure, retention, destruction and protection of Information. As a result, the following description is an overview only of the use generally made of Information for the purpose of providing services through the Maple Platform. A particular Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Providers may or may not chose to collect or use Information as described below in connection with a particular interaction with a User.<\/p>\n<h4>Healthcare Services<\/h4>\n<p>Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers may collect Information about you or any Registered Dependent (as defined below) when you provide it during a Healthcare Services consultation (e.g., verbally or in texts), by viewing the Information that you have entered or uploaded to the Maple Platform and\/or by creating or compiling Information in the Maple Platform. Information that will be available to Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers includes: the details that you provide in your consultation request; information you\u2019ve entered or uploaded to profiles and medical records; information created during earlier interactions through the Maple Platform with other Authorized Physicians and\/or Authorized Non-Physician Providers; the name, email address, phone number, gender and date of birth and province\/territory that you provided when you registered; and your emergency contact\u2019s name and contact information. Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers use Information to provide you with Healthcare Services and\/or Informational Services and, as with any healthcare provider, must comply with the privacy legislation and medical record-keeping obligations to which they are subject. Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers may create Information such as prescriptions, sick notes and other notes about your interaction with them through the Maple Platform. They may export or print copies of your Information that they collect. Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers may, but are not required to email or text your emergency contact if they believe that you are dealing with a medical emergency during a consultation. You are responsible for advising your emergency contact that you are providing their name and contact information to Maple and Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers, and for obtaining any necessary consent from them for the provision and use of their information in connection with the Maple Platform.<\/p>\n<h4>Informational Services<\/h4>\n<p>Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers collect and use Information that you provide in the course of obtaining Informational Services, by viewing the information that you have entered or uploaded to the Maple Platform and by creating or compiling Information in the Maple Platform. The Information that they collect and use includes: the details that you provide in your request for Informational Services and information that you provided to register to use the Maple Platform (name, gender, date of birth and place of residence) to confirm your eligibility to receive Informational Services.

You may also specify whether you\u2019re seeking to renew a prescription or obtain a sick note. We facilitate your disclosure to the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider of that information, along with age and gender to determine whether your request is eligible. We do not identify you, or, if applicable, the Registered Dependent for whom you\u2019re seeking the Healthcare Services.

For example, we notify you about the status of your consultations and other requests, such as prescription orders.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect location data through the use of GPS technology and your IP address where applicable to services you have requested, e.g., ensuring you are connected to an Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider or pharmacy that is licensed or authorized to provide such services in the jurisdiction where you are located.

On your behalf, we present the information that you provide to an Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider to determine whether your request is eligible for Informational Services. We do not identify you. Once the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider confirms that your request is eligible, we identify the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider to you.

On termination, you will have an opportunity to print or make copies of your Information subject to the following. To ensure that Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers may exercise any authority they have to withhold Information they compile in connection with Healthcare Services from patients under the law, you will be required to request any access you would like to notes made by an Authorized Physician or an Authorized Non-Physician Provider about your consultation from the Authorized Physician or Authorized Non-Physician Provider. With the exception of residents of Prince Edward Island receiving Healthcare Services in Prince Edward Island, Maple is not the custodian of Information held on the Maple Platform; rather it holds Information on behalf of Users or Authorized Physicians and Authorized Non-Physician Providers. For residents of Prince Edward Island receiving Healthcare Services in Prince Edward Island, Maple is a custodian, as defined by the PEI Health Information Act.
