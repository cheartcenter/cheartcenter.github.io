In addition to specializing in skin, dermatologists also treat hair conditions including hair loss. Our dermatologists can assess your type of hair loss and provide an appropriate course of treatment if one is available.\u00a0<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What do dermatologists do?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dermatologists treat over 3,000 conditions of the skin, hair and nails. Many common conditions affecting these areas, like acne, nail infections or hair loss, only need a visual inspection to be diagnosed.\u00a0<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>When requesting a dermatology consultation on Maple, simply fill in your symptoms and attach any images you feel are needed. Your request will be securely sent to a licensed Canadian dermatologist for review and you&#8217;ll hear back with a diagnosis and treatment plan within 24 hours. If the dermatologist can&#8217;t help, your visit will not start and you will not be charged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What should I expect during my consultation?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once you enter your symptoms and attach any images that might be helpful, your request will be securely sent to a licensed Canadian dermatologist for review.

If the dermatologist can&#8217;t help, your visit will not start and you will not be charged. You are also able to book 15-minute follow-up appointments if necessary. These appointments cost $90.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What do dermatologists treat?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dermatologists treat conditions of the skin, hair and nails. This includes a wide variety of conditions like acne, alopecia (hair loss), psoriasis, rashes, eczema, nail infections, dermatitis, pigment disorders, skin infections, shingles and many more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How do dermatologists treat acne?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dermatologists are highly skilled in the treatment of acne. They begin by determining the type of acne you have by looking at pictures and asking questions about your skincare routine. Then, they&#8217;ll work with you to develop a suitable treatment plan. This can range from changes in your skin routine to topical creams and other prescription medications.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can dermatologists treat acne scars?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes! There are many different types of acne scars, each with their own solutions from dermabrasion to fillers or surgery. The dermatologist will start by determining the type of acne scars you have and then they&#8217;ll work with you to develop the best possible treatment plan. <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Do you need a referral to see a dermatologist?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can use Maple to schedule an appointment with an online dermatologist in Canada without a referral. For an in-person appointment, you need a referral from a general practitioner or primary care physician to see a dermatologist.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>How much does it cost to see a dermatologist?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Online consultations for dermatology are $180 and include the applicable diagnosis, and any necessary treatment plans or prescriptions. You can also book 15-minute follow-up appointments for $90, if the dermatologist would like to follow your condition. Since consultations take place over secure messaging, and we use a national network of dermatologists, visits typically don&#8217;t qualify for provincial insurance coverage.<\/p>\n\t<h2>\n\t\tMore dermatology resources\n\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/img_couch@2x.png\" alt=\"img_couch@2x\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"890\" width=\"998\" title=\"img_couch@2x\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<h2>Face the world with confidence.
