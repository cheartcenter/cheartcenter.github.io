After medical school, they train for at least four more years in pediatrics: the care of infants, children, and youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What can an online pediatrician treat?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>All pediatricians on Maple are highly experienced and dedicated to providing the best care for their young patients. They can help with many things, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coughs, colds, flus, headaches, and fevers<\/li>\n<li>Vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation<\/li>\n<li>Skin problems<\/li>\n<li>Allergies and allergic reactions<\/li>\n<li>&#8230; and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To find out if an online pediatrician can help your child, simply submit a request and you&#8217;ll hear back in 48 hours or less. If your request is not suitable for online diagnosis and treatment, the pediatrician will let you know, and you won&#8217;t be charged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>When should I see a pediatrician vs. a family doctor?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The biggest difference between a pediatrician and a family doctor is that pediatricians specialize in child and youth health, whereas family doctors see patients of all ages. Pediatricians spend most of their time treating children, while family doctors only spend 10% of their time treating children.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unsure of whether to see a family doctor or a pediatrician, ask yourself whether you&#8217;re looking to speak with a doctor for a reason that is minor or major. For general and minor issues like your child&#8217;s cough or sore throat, a family doctor would be great. But if you&#8217;re dealing with major issues specific to children like behavioural issues, feeding difficulties, chronic conditions, or a complicated medical history, it&#8217;s best to speak with a pediatrician as they&#8217;re doctors dedicated to children&#8217;s developmental and health needs.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/blog\/pediatrician-vs-gp-how-to-choose\/\">blog<\/a> on choosing between pediatricians and family doctors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/img_couch@2x.png\" alt=\"img_couch@2x\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"890\" width=\"998\" title=\"img_couch@2x\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<h2>You want the best for your kids.
