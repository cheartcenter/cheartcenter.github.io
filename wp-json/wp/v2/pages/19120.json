You may be helping a partner or spouse, an aging parent, a child with special needs, a relative, a friend, or a neighbour.<\/p>\n<p>A caregiver coach is someone who provides support to caregivers and helps them navigate the stresses that come with their responsibilities. As a result, caregivers are better able to make informed decisions to meet the challenges of providing care for a loved one.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What can a caregiver coach assist with?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Caregiver coaches on Maple can help you with many different aspects of caregiving, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Juggling caregiving, work, parenting, and other responsibilities<\/li>\n<li>Managing difficult conversations with family members<\/li>\n<li>Understanding how the healthcare, home care, and long-term care systems work, and how to better navigate them<\/li>\n<li>Proposing resources and services that can help you<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Where is this service available?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This service is available nationwide, in all provinces and territories.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can I see the same coach each time?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes.
