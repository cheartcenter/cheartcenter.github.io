While it\u2019s true that speech-language pathologists can help with these issues, they also provide many other services. speech-language pathologists can help with speech delays and disorders, including articulation, phonology, and motor speech disorders, language delays and disorders, swallowing and feeding disorders, and much more, for children and adults.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speech-language pathologists are highly educated professionals who are required to study anatomy and physiology and also study genetics, neuroanatomy, linguistics, human and language development, psychology, acoustics and more. They are qualified to evaluate, and treat a broad range of delays and disorders.<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Occupational therapists are regulated healthcare professionals. Becoming an occupational therapist typically requires six to seven years of schooling, which includes an undergraduate degree, a Masters Program, and a provincial certification exam.<\/p>\r\n<p>All OTs on Maple are licensed in Canada.<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button data-more=\"See more\" data-less=\"See less\">See more<\/button>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Are speech-language pathologists licensed?<\/h6>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The professions of speech-language pathology and audiology are regulated in all Canadian provinces except for Prince Edward Island and the Northern Territories. In Ontario, speech-language pathologists are governed by the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists (CASLPO).
