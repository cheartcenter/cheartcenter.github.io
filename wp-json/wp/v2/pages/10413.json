Practitioners look to identify and address the root causes of disease, not just the symptoms. By getting holistic health assessments, patients can be potentially liberated from their chronic dependence on the healthcare system. <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>Can functional medicine practitioners write prescriptions?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Functional medicine practitioners prefer to use natural remedies whenever possible. They may also recommend that blood tests be ordered. <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What&#8217;s the difference between functional medicine and naturopathy?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Functional medicine aims to address the underlying factors that can influence long term health and complex chronic disease. Functional medicine providers may recommend conventional medicine or natural remedies and lifestyle modifications.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The goal of naturopathic medicine is to treat a person&#8217;s mind, body, and spirit. Naturopathy offers alternative medicine and natural remedies, but not conventional medicine to help heal the body.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What will happen during my first visit?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A big part of your first visit involves exploring your detailed personal and family medical history. Depending on the outcome of the consultation, you may be given suggestions such as lifestyle and dietary modifications, to address the potential root causes of the issues presented. Further blood tests and\/or functional medicine testing may also be suggested.\u00a0<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h6>What are the benefits of functional medicine?<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Functional medicine provides you with a personalized care plan, which is customized for genes, environment, and lifestyle. By looking at health from a holistic perspective, functional medicine can help you uncover and address the underlying root causes of various chronic health conditions. <\/p>\n\t<h2>Testimonials<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/star_filled-svg.png\" alt=\"star_filled-svg\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"52\" width=\"294\" title=\"star_filled-svg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>&#8220;Noelle is most deserving of my gratefulness for her guidance with my lifestyle medical health plan. It finally hit home that my health issues were not impossible to control as seen from her new perspectives in health management. It means that I will be an active participant, on board with Noelle, in a healthy life&#8217;s direction. I have found what I have been looking for with her knowledge and innovative research practices. Noelle has made me feel empowered and in control again of this most important aspect of my life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Frank B.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/star_filled-svg.png\" alt=\"star_filled-svg\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"52\" width=\"294\" title=\"star_filled-svg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>&#8220;I had been taking an SSRI medication for years (I was given it for vertigo) and I felt like I was in a fog all the time and was becoming very forgetful. I am so grateful to Noelle for guiding me as to how to go about getting this medication out of my system. Just want to let you know how much better I am as I am continuing to wean myself off a medication that had too many negative effects on me. I am almost completely off it and I have never felt so good to know this was possible; it feels like the curtain has risen on me and I am back to the person I was before this medication took over my life for the worse. You are so caring and so knowledgeable and a blessing in my life. Forever grateful.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Janet M.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/star_filled-svg.png\" alt=\"star_filled-svg\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"52\" width=\"294\" title=\"star_filled-svg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned many things during my time with Noelle. Unlike my other practitioners (I&#8217;ve had many) she is very patient and always follows up with me to make sure that I capture all the information I need to make informed health decisions for myself. I was getting the best information possible. Perhaps the most important has been that there are tests to help identify the things that have been causing issues and that there are programs aimed for treating them. I feel better than I&#8217;ve felt in a very long time. I have had increased energy and an improved disposition. I simply cannot say enough. Noelle keep up with all you do. You are making huge differences in people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Mark B.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/star_filled-svg.png\" alt=\"star_filled-svg\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"52\" width=\"294\" title=\"star_filled-svg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>&#8220;I have met with Noelle twice using the Maple platform. I have found her to be knowledgeable, personable and a good listener. She quickly got to the root of my concerns, while delving deeply into my medical history, making connections and treating my whole being, as opposed to focusing on symptoms.I felt heard. After our consult, she was quick to upload recommendations and additional reading material. I will definitely book future appointments with Noelle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Samantha W.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.getmaple.ca\/site-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Footer.png\" alt=\"Footer\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"1013\" width=\"1171\" title=\"Footer\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<h2>Start living your best life today.<\/h2>\n<p>Maple revolves around your needs and schedule.
