										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a middle-aged man, and you’ve been noticing unexplained changes to your body or mood recently, you shouldn’t ignore these signs. You could be experiencing low testosterone levels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you dismiss this as a possibility, it’s important to note that not only do one in four men have low testosterone, but less than 5% of cases are diagnosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an extremely low percentage of diagnosed cases. It also means there are a significant number of men who have low testosterone levels, but haven’t gotten help yet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low testosterone is nothing to be embarrassed about, but for some men, the symptoms this condition can cause can feel embarrassing to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without help, this condition won’t go away on its own. To help men identify symptoms of potentially low testosterone levels, we’ve put together a list of five common identifying signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before we talk about some recognizable signs of low testosterone, let’s talk about testosterone itself.</span></p>
<h3>What is testosterone?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testosterone is a hormone that’s produced by the human body. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some testosterone in women, produced through a combination of the adrenal gland and ovaries, but in much smaller volumes than men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man’s testosterone is produced through his testicles.</span></p>
<h3>Why is testosterone important to us?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man’s appearance, as well as his sexual drive and development, is affected by testosterone. When a man’s testosterone levels are low, it can have negative impacts on multiple others areas of his body as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testosterone also plays a role in building muscle and bone mass for both men and women.</span></p>
<h3>1) It’s affecting your sex life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re someone who’s normally had a high sex drive, and now find yourself uninterested in sex, low testosterone could be to blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only could low testosterone levels affect your interest in sex, but they could also impact your ability to perform. This could manifest as difficulty getting or maintaining an erection or through a lower-than-normal volume of semen released during ejaculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These symptoms can feel emasculating and encourage other negative symptoms like anxiety or depression.</span></p>
<h3>2) You’re tired all the time</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your energy levels been down recently? Do you feel exhausted after the smallest tasks, or too tired to even bother doing the things you normally enjoy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already tried getting more sleep at night, but aren’t finding it makes a difference, the issue could be your testosterone levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This symptom can have a huge impact on your daily life, pushing you away from the things you love to do. Also, avoiding physical activities because you’re tired all the time can worsen other symptoms like weight gain.</span></p>
<h3>3) You’ve been putting on weight</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men that have low testosterone can experience an increase in body fat, particularly around the abdominal and chest regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, this can even lead to gynecomastia, also known as enlarged breast tissue. It’s believed this could be caused by affecting the balance between testosterone and estrogen levels in men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many men, this symptom can make them feel ashamed, even if they’ve been following a healthy regimen of diet and exercise. This embarrassment may make them feel hesitant to get medical advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that reversing this symptom may require treating your low testosterone levels first. So, speaking to an endocrinologist through Maple could be exactly what you need to get your weight back under control.</span></p>
<h3>4) You’ve noticed strange hair loss</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Male pattern baldness is extremely common. It affects more than 50% of all men over the age of 50, to some extent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, low testosterone levels can cause hair loss, or affect hair on other parts of the body (i.e., facial hair, pubic hair, etc.). It can also cause hair to become thinner, rather than falling out completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unusual to begin losing body hair without cause. In these situations, it’s good to make sure you have your hormone levels tested through an endocrinologist.</span></p>
<h3>5) You’re having mood swings</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hormones have a huge impact on our moods and mental states, so it’s no surprise that low testosterone levels would lead to changes in mood. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re finding yourself feeling irritable, anxious, or depressed, and you don’t know why, it could be the result of low testosterone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low testosterone levels can also affect your ability to focus and your memory, which can have a huge impact on your ability to function.</span></p>
<h3>When should I speak with an endocrinologist?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endocrinologists are specialists who have expertise in dealing with hormone imbalances, like low testosterone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re experiencing some of the symptoms above, it could be a good idea to meet with an endocrinologist. They’ll be able to arrange to have your testosterone levels checked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may be able to offer helpful treatment options, but first you’ll need to have testing done to confirm a diagnosis.</span></p>
<h3>Can Maple help me if I have low testosterone?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endocrinology is one of our top specialties. We can put you in touch with a physician or endocrinologist who will help you identify the cause of your symptoms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a diagnosis, we’ll be able to suggest treatment options that can help you minimize your symptoms and manage your condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low testosterone is nothing to be embarrassed about. Ignoring your symptoms and hoping they’ll go away isn’t the answer. Reach out to us today and let us help you on your health journey.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the first steps in your journey towards weight loss can be daunting, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ut you don’t have to do it alone. Dietitians are a fantastic resource you can leverage when you’re trying to lose weight. They work with you to create realistic plans and set achievable goals. They’ll also help you find solutions to obstacles you hit along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of a dietitian isn’t to give you easy answers. There are no easy answers for weight loss. A dietitian’s goal is to help you better understand how to make intelligent choices regarding your diet, which will ultimately have a positive impact on your health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We make it simple to meet with a dietitian. All you have to do is schedule a visit on our platform so you can get started right away. </span></p>
<h3>Personalized tips and tricks</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a bad food-related habit you’d like to break? A dietitian can help you find reasonable solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you drink a lot of soft drinks every day, a dietitian may suggest cutting back to a single cup per day. Are you a huge fan of pizza? You can still enjoy weekly pizza night if you start ordering more vegetable toppings, less fatty meats, and skip the extra cheese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all have foods we love that aren’t necessarily great for our diets, but that doesn’t mean we have to cut them out completely. A dietitian will work with you to identify food habits that could be hindering your weight loss plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve determined some foods that could be stumbling blocks for you, you can find healthier ways to build them into your diet. This way, you don’t have to remove them completely. By scheduling them into your meal plan, you can better control the volume you consume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not always about removing things completely from your diet. Instead, it’s about finding ways to enjoy them in moderation, so they don’t negatively impact your weight loss strategies.</span></p>
<h3>Building a diet plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from controlling how many “cheat” foods we consume, a dietitian will work with you to create a realistic diet plan for you to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This involves understanding all the factors that go into your body’s daily maintenance calories. These are the calories that your body requires each day to maintain your energy levels, while you go about your daily tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of calories we require varies widely from person to person. It’s calculated based on sex, age, weight, height, and the volume of physical activities you perform each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personalized diet plan will take all those factors into account. It can help you create a meal-planning system that promotes healthy, well-rounded eating habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best of all, your diet plan does this without forcing you to starve yourself or avoid your favourite foods entirely.</span></p>
<h3>Setting achievable goals</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to aim for the stars when you’re first starting your weight loss journey, but that may not be the most effective way to set goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you aim too high, you make it virtually impossible to reach those goals. When you don’t see the improvement you’d hoped for, it can be demoralizing and demotivating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it’s done in a healthy way, weight loss is a slow and steady process. It doesn’t happen overnight, and it can take months or years to achieve the goals you set out for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dietitian is going to help you set achievable goals that will be much more realistic to meet, and at shorter intervals. This way, you can pause throughout your journey to acknowledge the small improvements you’ve made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small improvements add up. If you stick to the plan the dietitian sets out for you, eventually you’ll be standing in front of the mirror wondering how you’ve come so far.</span></p>
<h3>Breaking through weight loss barriers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One obstacle many people avoid discussing when it comes to weight loss is reaching a plateau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At different points during your weight loss journey, you will likely reach points when your weight loss starts to slow down. The things you were doing before may not work as well anymore, and this could require you to reevaluate your current plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is normal. It doesn’t mean you’re not working hard enough, and it certainly doesn’t mean that the plan isn’t working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you lose weight, your body will begin to adjust to the things you’re doing, meaning the same efforts may not have the same results. Also, as you begin to shed weight and adjust your regular diet, your body’s maintenance calories go down. This means that your entire plan may need to be adjusted every few months to account for these changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t panic if you find yourself plateauing. Talk to your dietitian. They’ll be able to make suggestions to help you break through these barriers and continue onto the next steps in your weight loss journey.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a healthy long-term relationship with food</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss is only really helpful if it’s sustainable. You may shed a few pounds in a few months, but if you go back to your bad eating habits, you’ll gain them right back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a dietitian isn’t about finding short-term solutions. It’s about building a healthier, more well-balanced long-term relationship with food. Maintaining good habits means when you lose weight, you’re able to keep it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to manage your food choices and training yourself to maintain healthy eating habits indefinitely are the real benefits of working with a dietitian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight loss is simply a positive consequence of healthier, more well-rounded eating habits.</span></p>
<h3>Can Maple connect me with a dietitian online?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! We’re committed to helping you find the resources you need as part of your health journey, including putting you in touch with a licensed dietitian online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing weight isn’t easy, but you can count on us for guidance and support. We’ll do everything we can to provide you with all the tools you need to take the first successful steps in your weight loss journey.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2018004/article/54950-eng.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life expectancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for men is about four years less than it is for women. This is in part due to women being more likely to eat better, drink less, and wear sunscreen — among other things. Aging is inevitable, but certain interventions can help you increase your longevity — or at least live better, if not longer. Here are the top five health tips for men as they age. </span></p>
<h2>1. Use it or lose it</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 30, muscle mass begins to decline. The less you exercise, the faster this muscle loss happens. This can lead to a whole host of problems — from </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804956/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking,60%20%5B4%2C5%5D."><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduced mobility to disability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The good news is that a suitable exercise program can help you stay mobile and independent longer as you age. It can also help to stave off osteoporosis, and even </span><a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/physical-exercise#:~:text=Exercising%20in%20mid%2Dlife&amp;text=Combining%20the%20results%20of%2011,reduced%20by%2045%20per%20cent."><span style="font-weight: 400;">dementia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Adults between 18 and 64 need about </span><a href="https://csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/CSEP_PAGuidelines_0-65plus_en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150 minutes of exercise a week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in bouts of 10 minutes or more. Don’t worry about bench pressing, or running a marathon though — your exercise program should be attainable. Try an after dinner walk, ride your bike to work during the week, or lift small weights while you watch TV. You can’t stave off aging, but regular exercise can help you do it more healthfully. </span></p>
<h2>2. Reign in your drinking</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beer pong isn’t good for anyone, but as you get older, the effects of drinking alcohol become more pronounced. The volume of water in your body decreases as you age, so the alcohol you drink is less diluted in your body. This makes alcohol more difficult for your body to process, and therefore more toxic. While reducing your alcohol consumption is good, even a couple of daily drinks can lead to health issues. Two beers every evening might not seem like a lot, but the effects of alcohol are cumulative. Fatty liver disease, for example, can happen to drinkers who regularly consume only one to two drinks a day. If you’re a man, you should be especially aware of your alcohol consumption as you age, since </span><a href="https://www.ccsa.ca/sites/default/files/2019-04/CCSA-Canadian-Drug-Summary-Alcohol-2017-en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">men drink more than women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on average. There’s no need to give up alcohol entirely, but if you find that you drink daily, plan for at least a few alcohol-free days a week.</span></p>
<h2>3. Don’t forget the sunscreen</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain of a sunburn fades, but its long-term effects add up. Besides contributing to wrinkles, having just five sunburns over the course of your life doubles your risk for </span><a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">melanoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Places like your ears, the top of your head, and the backs of your hands receive more sun, and are especially vulnerable. This is particularly true if you work or spend a lot of time outside. About </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/chronic-diseases/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in 42</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> men will develop melanoma over their lifetime. Men are also much more likely to die of it than women, perhaps because they’re </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/709430/face-sunscreen-users-by-gender-canada/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly less likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to wear sunscreen. The good news is that skin cancer is preventable, and the earlier it’s caught, the better your prognosis will be. So slather on the SPF and pay attention to any new or changing moles. If you notice one with asymmetrical or irregular borders, or if it&#8217;s multiple colours, very dark, has increased in size, or if it’s elevated, see a </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/dermatologists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dermatologist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as soon as possible. Early detection could save your life.</span></p>
<h2>4. Make time to de-stress</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little bit of stress at the right time works in your favour. It can help motivate you, and even increase resilience — think about the stress of starting a new job, for example. Chronic stress, however, is another story. Your body isn’t meant to be in a heightened state all the time, and constantly exposing yourself to stress has profound consequences. Over time, chronic stress is responsible for everything from weakening your immune system to suppressing your sex drive. And because it’s associated with a number of diseases, most notably </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137920/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">atherosclerosis and depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, chronic stress may even shorten your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to remove all stress from your life. Learning to manage it, however, allows your systems to de-escalate, and gives your body a chance to repair itself. There are a number of ways to do this — exercise, meditation, or a mindfulness practice. But really, whatever works to take the pressure off for you is beneficial. </span></p>
<h2>5. Maintain your social relationships</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an extrovert or an introvert, socializing is a key part of aging well. People with fulfilling interpersonal relationships are happier than those without them. Having a strong social network isn’t just about mental health, however. There’s an extensive body of research on the benefits of social connection, and it’s clear that our physical health also depends on having strong social bonds. People with higher levels of social connectedness have </span><a href="http://ccare.stanford.edu/uncategorized/connectedness-health-the-science-of-social-connection-infographic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower levels of anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, higher self-esteem, and are better at regulating themselves emotionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that social isolation goes hand-in-hand with declines in physical and mental health, including higher levels of depression — the COVID-19 pandemic has made this painfully obvious. Health-wise, </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/loneliness-has-same-risk-as-smoking-for-heart-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loneliness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is up there with smoking and obesity, and isolation is actually a </span><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4865/540"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk factor for mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Counteract these effects by staying connected as you age. Keep up with your friendships, and make a point of joining a club, religious organization, or volunteering — whatever keeps you feeling more connected to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t control your own mortality, but your quality of life as you get older is up to you. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong social support can go a long way towards helping you feel younger as you get older.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadians look forward to the lazy, hazy days of summer all year, but the warm, humid weather isn’t always so hot for your hair. That thick, moist air doesn’t just weigh you down, it also flattens your curls. If you have straight hair, the humidity is all but guaranteed to frizz it out. But the change in season won’t just ruin your hairstyle, it can also affect the overall health of your hair. Here’s how to counteract some of the stress the change of season has on your hair.</span></p>
<h2>Hair health and the sun</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting out from under your winter toque into that warm sunshine is a glorious feeling, but those sun-kissed highlights come with a cost. Just like your skin, your hair is also vulnerable to the sun’s rays. Summer sunshine gives you those natural highlights because your hair is being bleached by UV rays. While your hair colour might be killer, the trade off is drier, more brittle hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the pandemic is keeping you from your regular salon visits, your hair’s dryness may be even more noticeable this summer. To counteract this, bring along a hat with UV protective fabric if you know you’ll be out in the sun for a while. If you have fine or thin hair, this will do double duty and protect your scalp from sunburn as well. You can also use a weekly deep-conditioning treatment to add some additional moisture to your hair, and if you’re a daily hair washer, try  alternating days to leave some of your hair’s natural oils intact.</span></p>
<h2>Chlorine is not your friend</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few things are more relaxing than lounging by the pool in the summer. Chlorine, however, is enemy number one when it comes to your hair. Chlorine strips the natural oils from your hair and your skin, leaving both in desperate need of moisture. It can also cause chemical reactions in colour-treated hair and natural hair colour. So if you’re going to take a dip, go prepared. If you regularly swim laps, a bathing cap is a must to keep your hair healthy. For simply lounging in the water, ditch the rubber cap and hang out with your head above water. If that doesn’t work, you can apply a deep conditioning treatment before you take the plunge. Alternatively, you can rinse your hair with cold water before going under. Your hair can only absorb so much water, so it’s better that it takes in the freshwater rather than the chlorine-infused pool water.</span></p>
<h2>Style for the season</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a clothes iron to straighten your hair, you know that it leaves your locks pin straight and thoroughly fried. The heat from a summer’s day isn&#8217;t as drastic, but in combination with hot styling tools, it quickly adds up. If you colour treat your hair, it’s likely to be even more susceptible to damage from heat and the sun. The good news is that summer calls for a more carefree approach to styling. If you can, opt for natural styles over ones that require a curling or straightening iron. And if you have to use a hot styling tool, make sure to protect the health of your hair with a leave-in conditioning treatment first.</span></p>
<h2>Your hormones and your hair</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testosterone is usually thought of as a male hormone. It’s actually present in both sexes, however,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and your levels of it are usually higher in the spring and fall. Since </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-46911-7_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fluctuations in hormonal levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can cause you to shed more hair than usual, many of us see additional hair loss during seasonal shifts. Melatonin is another hormone that regulates </span><a href="https://www.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/new/resumenI.cgi?IDARTICULO=56418"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the body grows hair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and your body makes less of it with the increased sunshine of the summer months. This likely contributes to having more resting follicles during summer, which are essentially hairs that are just waiting to fall out — so if you notice more hair loss during the dog days of summer, you’re probably right.</span></p>
<h2>Diet and hair health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you take into your body manifests externally. For some, the change in season comes with a significant change in eating and drinking habits. If your summer diet means drinking more alcohol than usual, or upping your junk food intake, you might see the effects in your hair. Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals may cause hair loss. Less extreme cases, however, can cause </span><a href="https://www.hairscientists.org/hair-and-scalp-conditions/nutrition-and-hair-health"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dry, stringy, and dull hair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Limit these effects by eating a </span><a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balanced diet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Aim for five to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and make sure you’re taking in enough protein and fat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that the change in season can affect your hair. But if you find that your hair is going through a major transformation, it might be more than just a transition of the equinox. </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/hypothyroidism-treatment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thyroid disorders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stress, some medications, and illness can all trigger hair changes. If you notice that your hair brush is fuller than usual, or you have to buy a robot vacuum to deal with all the shedding, it’s worth taking stock to see if you have any other symptoms. Your hair loss might be attributable to something other than the change of season.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you feel like the impact of your gut health goes beyond how well you digest your food, you’re not alone. Nearly </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/"><span style="font-weight: 400">70% of your immune system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> resides in your gut, and science is beginning to discover how gut health impacts overall wellness. From skin concerns like </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/rosacea-treatment/"><span style="font-weight: 400">rosacea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to digestive complaints like constipation, many chronic health issues may have their roots in the internal microbiome. Here’s how a naturopathic doctor can help with gut health. </span></p>
<h2>What’s really going on in your gut</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of our bodies plays host to about </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665491/"><span style="font-weight: 400">100 trillion microorganisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They’re so prevalent, that scientists think the ratio of these microbes to our own cells is one-to-one. The number one spot these little guys congregate is in our gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). So many are present there, that it contains somewhere between one to two kilograms of them. These gut microorganisms play crucial roles in our bodies’ functioning. They&#8217;re instrumental in everything </span><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> from how our digestion and immune systems operate, to regulating our moods and inhibiting inflammation.</span></p>
<h2>What’s involved in a naturopathic consultation?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your first consultation with a naturopathic doctor will begin with an in-depth discussion of current health concerns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;ll also cover other relevant topics like your diet, sleep, medical and family history, and stress levels. This allows them to gather the information they need to investigate the root cause of your concerns. Depending on what they uncover, your naturopathic doctor might recommend more comprehensive testing. They’ll also help you devise a treatment plan. This may include supplements, herbal recommendations, dietary modifications, and lifestyle support such as stress management techniques.</span></p>
<h2>Are you living with unwanted intestinal guests?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While each of us hosts a diversity of microorganisms, there are certain ones that shouldn&#8217;t be part of our microbiome. When we find ourselves invaded by, say, a parasite, it can wreak havoc on our gut health. If you spent part of your 20s drinking tap water in Bolivia, or eating from a roadside vendor in Thailand and developed digestive complaints afterwards, this might be applicable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, stool tests are part of a naturopathic doctor’s arsenal. These tests can look for things like parasites, or undesirable bacteria, or viruses that may be residing in your gut. Hosting a parasite or a malevolent bacterial colony may sound distressing. Once you know, however, your naturopathic doctor can devise a treatment plan. With the right antibiotic or naturopathic prescription, you can say goodbye to any unwanted gastrointestinal tenants. </span></p>
<h2>What your breath says about your gut health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your microbiome is affected by many different factors, including how you’re born, and whether you’re breastfed, which medicines and antibiotics you take, as well as which foods you eat. Naturopathic doctors focus on balancing the microbiome. One of the ways they do this is by looking at which bacteria are present in your gut. One tool at their disposal is a breath test. This at-home diagnostic test kit looks at the different gases present in your exhalations, and can showcase which bacteria may be present in your GI tract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A common issue easily diagnosed with a breath test is SIBO, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. SIBO is when a species of bacteria becomes too prevalent in your small intestines. When this happens, the bacteria often emits high levels of hydrogen. This can cause uncomfortable issues like bloating, loose stool, gas, diarrhea, nausea, feeling uncomfortably full, and in severe cases, malnutrition — basically every digestive symptom you don’t want. If your breath test indicates SIBO, your naturopathic doctor can prescribe a treatment plan to eradicate the bad bacteria and heal your gut to rebalance your inner microbiome.</span></p>
<h2>How your saliva can impact your gut</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like your gut, your mouth is also home to a plethora of different bacteria species. Since what you swallow ends up in your gut, your mouth bacteria is potentially tied to your gut health. The bacteria associated with gingivitis, for example, is implicated in dysbiosis (imbalance) of the gut bacteria in susceptible individuals. Although more research is required, some scientists believe that some kinds of oral bacteria </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2020.620254/full"><span style="font-weight: 400">may even play a role</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). If you’re experiencing gut issues, saliva tests are another tool naturopathic doctors can use to assess what may be going on.</span></p>
<h2>Gut health and your immune system</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaky gut could be a term you’ve heard at some point – maybe as an explanation of an autoimmune condition, or even depression. While the research is still out on the full details, preliminary evidence suggests that certain bacteria and food can traverse the lining of the gut. From there, they enter the bloodstream, sparking inflammation. This inflammation can play a part in a number of conditions, like </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6658985/"><span style="font-weight: 400">depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, multiple sclerosis, and certain forms of </span><a href="https://arthritis.ca/about-arthritis/arthritis-types-(a-z)/types/inflammatory-arthritis"><span style="font-weight: 400">arthritis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Your naturopath can work with you to determine if you may be experiencing a leaky gut as the result of food intolerances or other factors, and help you devise a treatment plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re experiencing </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/what-your-digestive-issues-are-telling-you-about-your-health/"><span style="font-weight: 400">digestive difficulties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a naturopathic doctor can help you track down the root causes. From chronic constipation to diarrhea, and everything in between, digestive issues can be pretty uncomfortable. The good news is you don’t have to resign yourself to living with uncomfortable GI symptoms. Speak to a naturopathic doctor about how they can help you rebalance your microbiome for a healthier gut.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking may seem like second nature for most people, but for people experiencing speech disorders, that isn’t the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe you or your child may have a speech disorder, this article will help clarify some information about what can be considered a speech disorder. We’ll also talk about how speech disorders can affect your ability to speak, some common causes, and frequently used treatments.</span></p>
<h2>What is a speech disorder?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most people may recognize a few different types of speech disorders, there’s actually a wide range of conditions relating to speech disorders. Some may be present at birth, or develop over a long period of time. There are some speech disorders caused by issues relating to neurological function, and others that are the result of disabilities or injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speech disorders are conditions that affect a person’s ability to make the sounds necessary to form words. These can also affect the fluency of their words or the quality of their voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are not to be confused with language disorders. Language disorders impair a person’s ability to learn new words or understand what is being said to them, or their use of spoken, written, or symbol systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speech disorders can prevent you from communicating clearly with other people, or make it difficult to articulate yourself when you’re trying to speak.</span></p>
<h2>What are some common speech disorders?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a wide range of conditions that fall into the category of speech disorders, but the three most commonly occurring speech disorders are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuttering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apraxia</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dysarthria</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This discussion will focus on these most frequently occurring types of speech disorders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other types of speech disorders include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orofacial myofunctional disorders (relating to abnormal growth or development of the facial bones and muscles, such as cleft lip, palate, or tongue-tie)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articulation disorders (relating to the inability to form specific sounds, causing verbal distortion when speaking)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluency disorders (developmental stuttering or neurologic stuttering)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice disorders (misuse or organic changes of the vocal mechanism such as vocal polyps, nodules, or webbing to name a few)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autism-related speech disorders (relating to possible language disorders, as well)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resonance disorders (relating to blockages in the mouth, nose, and throat, which causes changes to voice quality)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What can cause a speech disorder?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two different types of stuttering speech disorders, each with their own causes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neurogenic stuttering refers to stuttering caused by an issue preventing proper coordination between the different parts of the brain that allow for speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developmental stuttering typically affects young children who are still learning to speak. The risks of this occurring in children could be increased dramatically, depending on the child’s genetics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apraxia is caused by damage to the parts of the brain that allow the brain to communicate with different parts of the body. Verbal apraxia refers to an issue with the motor skills that allow a person to speak or correctly form the sounds of words &#8211; even if they know what they want to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dysarthria on the other hand is a condition affecting the tone, strength, and coordination of all or any of the muscles used for speaking. This weakness may make speech very difficult for the person affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some direct causes of the brain damage or muscle weakness relating to speech disorders include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vocal cord damage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strokes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodules or polyps on the vocal cords</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vocal cord paralysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respiratory weakness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head injury</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dementia</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Degenerative diseases (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down syndrome</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing loss</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What are some signs and symptoms of a speech disorder?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most commonly seen signs and symptoms of speech disorders include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repetition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elongating words or sounds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerky movements while speaking (usually involving the head)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustration when trying to speak</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blinking repeatedly while talking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding extra sounds or words when speaking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rearranging syllables</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty with pronunciation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking very quietly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking in a raspy, gravelly, or hoarse voice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distorting sounds when speaking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent pauses between words</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking very slowly</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How are speech disorders diagnosed?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that you or your child could have a speech disorder, there are numerous steps involved in a speech disorder diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The physician will first discuss your medical and academic histories, arrange emotional and intelligence evaluations and evaluate your interactions with them during the examination. They will also suggest hearing and vision testing be performed, before suggesting any specific speech disorder tests be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some frequently suggested speech disorder tests include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver articulation screening exam</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic evaluation of motor speech skills manual (DEMSS)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosody-voice screen profile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early language milestones scale 2</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peabody picture vocabulary test</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests will help determine if you have a speech disorder, but they won’t necessarily determine the exact causes of your speech disorder. Additional testing may be required to determine the underlying cause of your speech disorder, so that appropriate treatments can be recommended.</span></p>
<h2>How are speech disorders treated?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of speech therapy treatments that are recommended for you will normally depend on the severity of your condition, as well as what the doctor has determined the underlying cause of your condition might be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common type of speech therapy treatment is speech therapy, which focuses on exercises to build familiarity with using certain sounds or words. This could also involve physical exercises designed to strengthen muscles that allow us to produce sounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, there are other treatments that could be suggested, depending on your condition. Some of these include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrast therapy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target selection therapy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oral-motor therapy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contextual utilization therapy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ear devices (to replay an altered version of the wearer’s voice, or provide a sound that helps control stuttering)</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraines occur when you can least afford them. Often before an exam, or a major work deadline. Knowing you’re about to spend the next few hours — or more — in intense pain is awful. It’s even more inconvenient when stress is what brought your migraine on in the first place. Why do migraines and stress go together so often?</span></p>
<h2>What is migraine?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraine is a condition characterized by severe, recurrent headaches, but migraine symptoms aren’t confined to just throbbing head pain. Many people who experience migraines also report nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and even sweating and diarrhea. They often experience something called a migraine aura as a precursor to their episode. These auras often manifest as visual disturbances, dizziness, or ringing in the ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While different people report different triggers for their migraines, we don’t yet know what migraines’ underlying cause is. Scientists speculate that it might be due to abnormal brain activity affecting the nerves and blood vessels of the brain. In spite of the knowledge gap on their cause, we know that migraines are pretty common — more than </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24941316/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Canadians have one at some point or another. They’re also more likely to affect women — especially those in their 30s and 40s. </span></p>
<h2>Are migraines serious?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t get migraines, you may think they’re “just” headaches. But migraines can range in both severity and frequency, and are often debilitating. While some people who experience migraines report infrequent headaches, others find themselves afflicted much more frequently, with a subset reporting daily migraines. While many migraines might last for a few hours, some remain for days at a time. People who experience migraines often report that they’re unable to work, drive or participate in their usual activities when an attack comes on. In fact, migraines are the </span><a href="https://migrainecanada.org/disability-and-migraine/#:~:text=Among%20Canadian%20employees%2C%2056%25%20had,25%25%20reported%20being%20disabled."><span style="font-weight: 400;">third leading cause of missed workdays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Canada, coming in after back pain and </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6337984/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mood disorders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which they often go hand-in-hand with. </span></p>
<h2>Stress and migraines</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475609/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of people who experience migraines report stress as one of their triggers, especially when it comes to those experiencing daily migraine attacks. One theory is that the migraine brain is hypersensitive — potentially one of the reasons why light can make a migraine attack so much worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migraines and stress can often become a vicious circle; stress precipitates migraine, and the migraine episode itself causes more stress. We know that people who experience migraines are more likely to have depression or anxiety, but much like the connection between stress and migraines, it’s unclear how exactly they’re related. In other words, are the anxiety and depression related to the way the migraine brain works, or does living with migraine cause those disorders? Either way, be sure to tell your doctor if you have both migraines and another condition such as anxiety. It’s often beneficial to treat the two in tandem.</span></p>
<h2>What else can trigger migraines?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While stress is a major contributor to migraines, it’s only one of a number of triggers — even weather changes can bring on a migraine episode. Recording your migraine attacks and what preceded them may help you to narrow down your triggers, especially if they include food or certain activities. Other potential migraine triggers include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hormonal fluctuations, like getting your period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain medications, including the combination pill.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcohol.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of sleep or changes in sleep patterns, like jet lag.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain foods, especially ones containing nitrates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dehydration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staring at a screen for too long.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too much caffeine. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to prevent a stress migraine</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to prevent a stress migraine is to deal with your stress preemptively, whenever possible. Start by making sure you’re getting enough sleep. Next, make a list of any potential stressors and see if you’re able to break them up into smaller, more manageable pieces. Set aside time for stress-busting activities like exercise, meditation, and quality, screen-free time with your nearest and dearest. Dysregulation can be a migraine trigger, so sticking to a </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/five-tips-to-get-you-sleeping-better-tonight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sleep schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and eating regular meals made from whole foods is also crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel an attack coming on, you can try to head it off by lying down in a darkened room, or drinking a caffeinated beverage. Once your migraine is in full effect, however, many report that the only thing that offers relief is medication.</span></p>
<h2>When to worry about your migraine</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you experience regular migraines, it’s best to speak with a healthcare provider — if you haven’t already — to rule out any other potential issues. You should also see a doctor if you develop migraine auras in your 40s or later, if you’ve never had them previously. As well, if your migraines have become more frequent or debilitating, cause personality changes, or prevent you from completing daily tasks, it’s time to see a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress is fine in small doses, but too much stress, over too long a period can wreak havoc on you. For people who experience migraines, dealing with stress before it overwhelms you is one of the most powerful tools you have. Life — especially pandemic life — makes it impossible to avoid stress. But you can stop your stress from getting out of control.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-fat diets don’t get rid of fat. Until recently, conventional wisdom dictated that losing weight meant limiting the amount of fat in your diet. Then the keto diet exploded into popular culture, and turned that idea on its head. But is the keto diet really as effective as enthusiasts make it out to be? And is there anyone who shouldn’t follow it? Here’s everything you need to know if you’re considering going keto.</span></p>
<h2>What is the keto diet?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it might seem like a new fad, the keto diet has actually been around for 100 years. The keto diet was first used in the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19049574/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1920s to treat epilepsy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the discovery of anti-seizure medication, and is still used as an adjunct treatment in some juvenile patients with seizures today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The keto diet involves restricting your carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day. For reference, that’s about the amount in four slices of bread. Instead of getting your calories from carbohydrates, you’re supposed to sub in fats and fibrous vegetables. To be considered truly “keto”, you’re supposed to </span><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/ketogenic-diet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintain a ratio of 70 &#8211; 80% fat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 5-10% carbs, and 10-20% protein.</span></p>
<h2>How does the keto diet work?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you give it the chance, your body will use carbohydrates to power itself. That’s because carbs turn into glucose, which is the preferred source of energy for most of the body’s cells — if it’s available. When your body doesn’t have enough glucose floating around, it switches to breaking down fat molecules instead. These fat molecules turn into ketone bodies, which your cells can also use as a source of energy. This alternative form of powering yourself is called going into ketosis — hence the keto diet.</span></p>
<h2>What can I eat on the keto diet?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the ratio of fat to carbohydrates is so high on keto, you’re limited when it comes to many staples of the typical western diet — think no bread, rice, potatoes, or pasta. While this is obvious, keto newbies are sometimes surprised to learn that higher-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables like apples, pears, and carrots are also off the table. There’s room to eat some fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries, provided you don’t go overboard. However,  meat, eggs, fish, nuts, cheese, seeds, and green, fibrous, vegetables are the main building blocks of the diet.</span></p>
<h2>Is the keto diet actually healthy?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One concern with the keto diet is the rise in LDL cholesterol that’s associated with an increased fat intake, including saturated fats. Another concern with this diet is that it’s difficult to stick to. With just about everything starchy off the table, it’s easy to wonder what’s actually left to eat. Some keto dieters find themselves resorting to processed and packaged keto foods — which often contain additives and unhealthy amounts of salt —  as a way of replacing diet staples like crackers and bread. For those who add the high-fat components of the diet but don’t stick to the low carb part of it, their keto-adjacent diet is a recipe for increased weight gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond making mealtimes more difficult, cutting out carbs becomes unhealthy if you go about it the wrong way. Apples, carrots, and bananas are some of the most accessible fruits and vegetables for people, but they’re also significant sources of carbohydrates. Cutting out fruits and vegetables like these without replacing them with low-carb ones can result in a nutritionally-deficient diet. </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/dietitian/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing a dietician</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help if you find yourself struggling with what to eat.</span></p>
<h2>Who should go keto?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that reducing your carbohydrate intake is good for both weight loss and lowering blood sugar levels. This means that the keto diet can be useful for both controlling your weight and managing pre-diabetes. Because the diet helps to control the amount of glucose in your blood, some doctors recommend it as a </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">treatment for obesity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and as a way of managing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the keto diet itself isn’t inherently unhealthy or dangerous, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, it&#8217;s important to consult with your doctor before beginning any new dietary regime. High-protein diets exacerbate conditions like kidney disease, for example, so going keto is potentially risky — especially if you swap your usual carbs for meat. Keto can also heighten your risk of developing </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17621514/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kidney stones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As well, if you take medications, know that changes in your nutrition can potentially affect your body’s reactions to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The keto diet has the potential to be a great tool for weight loss, and as a way to manage blood sugar. But it’s not all about eating bacon-wrapped cheese. Replacing carbohydrates with protein and fat is only good up to a point — without incorporating the proper amount of vegetables and fruits, you risk losing out on the fiber and vitamins you need to keep yourself healthy. If you’re considering going keto, speaking to a nutritionist can help you to avoid some of the most common keto pitfalls.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over a year now, you’ve been taking necessary precautions to avoid getting sick from COVID-19. Wearing a mask, social distancing, enduring lockdowns, the whole nine yards. While you’ve worked hard to protect yourself from COVID-19, the virus became even more contagious, mutating into what’s known as COVID-19 variants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what makes a variant different from the already contagious COVID-19 virus? And just how contagious are these variants? We’re going to break it all down for you so you’re armed with the information you need to stay safe.</span></p>
<h2>Why COVID-19 variants have appeared</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. All viruses evolve over time, and when a virus replicates, a slight change called a mutation can take place. When a virus goes through one or more new mutations, it&#8217;s called a </span><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnKvcqCjcKfJSY3L33zsAAKkEcaND4ck7s-bkWZB4Twk6uT0R6aCfaYaAga-EALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With COVID-19 circulating in a population and infecting many people, the likelihood of mutation increases. This is why multiple variants from around the world have appeared. </span></p>
<h2>What makes the variants so contagious?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’d love to say “back off variant, you aren’t that special”, variants have unique attributes that could make it easier for you to become infected. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is the spike protein that penetrates host cells, which causes infection. With a variant, there are mutations in the spike protein that allow it to stick to the cells much more easily. This means the variant is more easily transmissible, and could be more successful at </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/variants-askcbc-feb19-1.5918554"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making you sick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re exposed to one of the variants, you could become infected in a shorter amount of time. That’s why limiting interactions with others, wearing a mask, and maintaining physical distance are all important safety measures.</span></p>
<h2>What are the different variants?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, </span><a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/about/blog/2021/monitoring-covid-19-voc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three variants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have surfaced in Canada, as well as one </span><a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20210225_weekly_epi_update_voc-special-edition.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variant of interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The first variant, B.1.1.7, emerged in the U.K, and the first two cases in Canada were recorded in December of 2020. The second variant was B.1.351, first identified in South Africa, recorded here in January of 2021. The third variant was P.1, first seen in Brazil, recorded here in February of 2021. Studies have </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03426-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than other variants. However, it has not been proven yet to lead to any change in the severity of illness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, a new variant of interest called B.1.617, first detected in India, was recorded in Canada as well. You may have heard this variant of interest referred to as the “double mutant” –</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s because this specific variant carries two mutations. Up until now, mutations were spotted separately in other variants, never together. So far, 39 cases of B.1.617 have been reported in British Columbia, 36 in Ontario, 5 in Quebec, as well as 1 case each in Alberta, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, B.1.1.7 has been the most </span><a href="https://nccid.ca/covid-19-variants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> variant, with 90,515 cases across the country. There have been 3,180 reported cases of the P.1 variant, and 541 of the B.1.351 variant. </span></p>
<h2>Can you get sick from a variant if you’ve already had COVID-19?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already recovered from COVID-19, you may not be fully protected against the variants. More research is needed, but a report from </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know#:~:text=Those%20who%20did%20have%20the,1.351%20variant%20was%20spreading%20there."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johns Hopkins Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that when it comes to the B.1.351 variant specifically, even if you’ve had COVID-19 previously, you may still be at risk. While it has not been shown to cause more severe illness, health experts say there is a chance you could still become mildly or moderately ill. </span></p>
<h2>Will a variant make you more ill?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/961037/NERVTAG_note_on_B.1.1.7_severity_for_SAGE_77__1_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no conclusive evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that any of the variants will cause more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. The key thing to remember here is that the variants are more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contagious</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know it can be tedious hearing people say “wash your hands, keep your distance, wear a mask”, but it is so important to continue following these protocols to help keep you safe.</span></p>
<h2>Will the vaccine continue to work against all variants?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 vaccines currently being administered across Canada are expected to give at least some</span><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnLHZTod9XF7SOXVbJEmBM8l7f4sqhImFeiO_P10NdrCCcrbawfFHogaAiEOEALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protection against the variants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If any of the vaccines are proven to be less effective against one or more variants, changes to the vaccine’s composition can be made. That being said, it’s important to continue to keep your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands to reduce your risk of getting sick. </span></p>
<h2>How do you protect yourself from a COVID-19 variant?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting vaccinated and following safety guidelines is your best line of defence against COVID-19 variants. If you’re concerned about exposure or are not feeling well, get tested right away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you live in the Greater Toronto Area, Calgary, or Halifax, you can get a COVID-19 test quickly and conveniently for travel, work, or other reasons. Just log into the app and book an appointment with one of our care specialists to get tested at a location nearest you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caregiving refers to the practice of helping someone who has some care needs because of a physical or mental health condition. For family caregivers, this caregiving is unpaid. You may be helping a partner or spouse, an aging parent, a child with special needs, a relative, a friend, or a neighbour. </span></p>
<h2>What does caregiving look like?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caregiving tasks can be straightforward such as driving someone to medical appointments or picking up or dropping off groceries or medication, which could translate into an hour or so a week. They can also be more intensive, such as helping with daily living tasks like bathing, getting dressed, and eating. Caregiving almost always includes providing emotional support. When caregiving is intensive, it&#8217;s equivalent to a part-time – or even full-time – job in addition to your other responsibilities, such as work or your own family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors contribute to making the experience of caregiving more challenging than it was for previous generations. That being said, helping someone who has care needs can feel like the most natural thing in the world. If your partner or spouse has an illness or disease, you of course do your part in caring for them. Similarly, if aging parents need help with different tasks, many adult children &#8220;naturally&#8221; step up to provide care. </span></p>
<h2>Why you need caregiver support, and when it&#8217;s time to reach out for help</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a diagnosis of a serious illness or disease, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, kidney disease, or dementia. You want to plan for what lies ahead, but don’t know where to start.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your parent(s) are in physical decline and you believe they need more help to manage, but they refuse to accept it. You don’t know what to do.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your mom or dad is exhausted from caring for their partner or spouse and you want to lighten their load.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a diagnosis of dementia. You don’t know what to expect or how to respond to certain behaviours. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are feeling overwhelmed trying to juggle the care you are providing with your other responsibilities. You want to know how to better manage everything that&#8217;s on your plate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are stuck in cycles of negative emotions, like guilt, resentment, or anger. You want to get “unstuck”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a time of transition, from needing home care to downsizing to a move to a retirement home or long-term care home. You want to understand all the different options and attendant costs, plus how to have a conversation about this transition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is conflict and tension between siblings regarding the care needs of an aging parent. You could use some strategies on how to best resolve this tension.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t stop worrying about the person you&#8217;re caring for. You want to know how you can reduce this worrying.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to understand all the financial support and funding that&#8217;s available for you and the person you&#8217;re caring for.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need more support and outside help with caregiving so that you can focus on your paid work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your parent to be able to live safely and independently as possible at home. You need help to set this up.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You struggle with finding balance while also providing support to someone with mental health struggles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person you&#8217;re caring for is no longer able to make their own decisions about personal care or their finances. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a palliative diagnosis and you want to know more about end-of -life care.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re a planner. You want to make sure you&#8217;re doing everything you can now and plan for future care needs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>You don&#8217;t have to do it alone</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments you hear most often from people who have reached out to receive caregiver support are “I wish I had known about this sooner”, “I had no idea what support was out there for me and my family”, or “It feels so good to talk to someone about this”. There is no value in going at it alone, and no need to.</span></p>
