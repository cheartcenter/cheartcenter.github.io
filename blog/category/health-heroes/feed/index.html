										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing online doctor consultations as a way to actively pursue his goal of improving the quality of medical care in Canada, Dr.Bahl’s belief in Maple has lead him to be exceptionally influential in the growth of the service.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a platform, as an idea, and as a website, Maple just makes sense,” says Dr. Bharat Bahl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious to know more about Dr.Bahl? We discussed some of his interests in medicine and his experience as a Maple doctor.</span></p>
<h3>Why did you specialize in Emergency medicine?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s exciting. It’s interesting.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast pace is definitely one thing. It’s very much an instant gratification kind of field. I think that few aspects in medicine give you such a quick feedback that you’ve done something to change someone’s life, or that you’ve done something to make someone better.</span></p>
<h3>Why did you choose to be part of Maple?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was invited by one of my colleagues Dr. Shafik Dharamshi, who was one of the first doctors on Maple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s about time that we had this type of service in Canada and Maple does it right. It has a strong focus on patient safety, and works to recruit physicians who are comfortable and eager to be part of telemedicine. When I’m practicing as a physician on Maple, I feel safe.</span></p>
<h3>Why is the safe delivery of patient care important to you?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delivery of safe medical care is essential to our platform. It inspires trust in patients and providers. A key part of delivering safe medical care is the ability of the health care provider to access records of previous patient visits on Maple. This can help inform medical decision making. For example, if a previous medication did not work for the patient’s symptoms, a new one can be tried. Maple makes this easy because a Maple physician can effortlessly access previous medications prescribed on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety is also built into our triage system. Before a Maple physician sees a patient, they are able to view the person’s medical complaint. For example, a 65-year-old man with chest pain and shortness of breath should be seen in an Emergency Department. A Maple physician has the option of viewing that medical complaint and re-directing the patient immediately if that is what is needed. </span></p>
<h3>What other role do you have at Maple besides doing online consultations?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I help Maple in many different capacities, one of my initial roles was to help with physician recruitment (Canada wide, coast to coast). That’s still my primary role. Maple has also been doing a lot of other things, like providing inpatient care in Prince Edward Island. This and other projects will hopefully make Maple a more universal platform. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passion and delivery</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his work with Maple, Dr. Bahl is achieving his goal of changing the delivery of care in the Canadian medical industry. His Maple patients enjoy his personable character and how easy it is to connect with him on the platform. “Patients love the ability to see me from the comfort of their home,“ he said.</span></p>
<p>“There have been times where I’ve seen patients who for example suffer from agoraphobia, so they’re too afraid to leave the house. For them to even see their family doctor is like climbing a mountain. I’ve seen those patients [through Maple], they’re able to go onto their computer to see a doctor, have a prescription delivered to their home. I mean how much more convenient can it get?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practising Emergency Medicine and working with Maple takes up most of his time. The satisfaction of knowing he is part of the new model of patient care delivery motivates him every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The power of Maple is that you’re reaching out to people who otherwise would not be able to see a doctor for geographical reasons, for health reasons, for any number of reasons, and I think that’s really powerful,” he said.</span></p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>About Dr. Bharat Bahl: Dr. Bahl is a practicing emergency physician in the city of Toronto. He completed his Doctor of Medicine and Family Medicine training from the University of Toronto. He then obtained his speciality training in Emergency Medicine from the University of Ottawa. During his training Dr. Bahl won awards for both teaching and research. His current passions include providing high quality patient care, teaching the next generation of physicians and improving the quality of care provided in Emergency Departments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A personal story from a Maple team member about their mental health journey, and how immediate access to therapy could have helped.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ignored my demons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, I realized that it wasn’t normal to be angry every day, to cry as often as I did, to neglect activities I once loved, or to starve myself of proper nutrition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was in a <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Mental-Health-treatment">mental battle</a>, but I still believed everything was fine. I was convinced that if I saw a therapist, I’d only waste their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, a person with <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Depression-treatment">depression</a> wasn’t like me. At least that’s what I believed. I functioned like a ‘normal’ individual. I woke up in the mornings, took showers, and went about my day just like everyone else. I appeared fine, and that was the hardest part about seeking help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did I ignore the signs that signaled I wasn’t okay, everyone around me believed I was more than okay. In fact, they believed I was living my best life!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I wanted the most during my darkest times was to simply express how I felt to someone; someone who wouldn’t judge me for feeling the way I felt.</span></p>
<h2>My days in a mental battle</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the day, I went about my mundane daily routine that temporarily blocked my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to function ‘normally’ except everything around me seemed dull, and I felt lifeless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At night, I battled with my internal self before falling to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some nights were better than others, but most would leave me bawling my eyes out because of my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re ugly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one will ever want to be your friend.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re a failure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mental battle went on like this day after day, and month after month. Too afraid to seek help because well, ‘I was fine.’</span></p>
<h2>Seeking help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back to that difficult time, perhaps if I wasn’t so reluctant to speak to a therapist, and if care had been as accessible as it is today, maybe I would have gotten help sooner. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to immediately be heard and to get better, no matter your situation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We designed Maple to work alongside our current healthcare system. How does it do that? By tapping into the extra time that a doctor may have, outside of the clinic or hospital.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Time &#8211; a limited resource</h2>
<p>Medicine is a demanding profession. Approximately 50% of Canadian doctors work part time, and they may choose to do so for a number of reasons. Family obligations, personal development, and professional activities (like teaching or consulting) all take up time, and doctors have the same 24 hours in a day as we do. A telemedicine app like Maple gives doctors the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills to treat patients during their off-hours, whether they&#8217;re commuting, on vacation, or after work. It&#8217;s also entirely voluntary, which means our online doctors can opt into providing telemedicine services on Maple only when they have the capacity. And because this service is paid for by patients, there&#8217;s no financial impact on public resources. Maple frees up additional doctor hours without draining our current system. Talk about a win-win!</p>
<hr />
<h2>Our online doctors &#8211; helping a stretched healthcare system</h2>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever been to the ER knows &#8211; you&#8217;re in for a long wait. And it&#8217;s often not much better at a walk-in clinic. If your family doctor isn&#8217;t available, or if you live far away, there can be real obstacles to find quality care. It&#8217;s not exactly practical to drive a few hours to have someone check out your sore throat or itchy rash. This is where Maple comes in. Doctors have been using remote diagnosing tools like telemedicine for years. Maple provides an updated platform where they can take advantage of an internet connection to see and speak with their patients. Simple illnesses like <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/urinary-tract-infection-treatment/">UTIs</a>, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/allergies-treatment/">allergic reactions</a>, or <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/flu-treatment/">flus</a> (just to name a few) can be diagnosed and treated by online doctors.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Behind the scenes of Maple&#8217;s telemedicine platform</h2>
<p>We talked to Dr. Eric Fonberg (one of <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/doctors">our online doctors</a>), to get his take on the Maple system. He&#8217;s a Toronto-based physician who&#8217;s got more than just a few things on the go. On top of his duties in the ER, he also does consulting work for government agencies and hospitals and provides primary care in the arctic regions of Canada and developing countries several times a year. He&#8217;s also a big believer in the benefits of Maple and telemedicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Fonberg points out that physical examinations are often not required even during an in-person appointment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on a discussion of the symptoms with the patient, physicians can often arrive at a diagnosis and initiate treatment. Maple allows me to help additional patients during times that I previously couldn&#8217;t. For instance, I was in Australia for several weeks recently, and continued to be able to treat patients in real time in Canada, despite being overseas.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you think back to your own visits to a doctor, you might remember giving a sample of blood or urine for further testing, but getting a prescription for your illness anyway. In these cases, your doctor most likely already had a good idea what was making you sick.</p>
<p>There are other benefits for patients too. In a doctor&#8217;s office or emergency room, the wait is often much longer than the visit itself, which can sometimes be rushed if there&#8217;s a lot of people in line. Maple sessions have no time limit. As Dr. Fonberg says, &#8220;I can take as much time as each patient needs, to treat their case.&#8221; This often translates into better care and higher patient (and doctor) satisfaction. With Maple, there&#8217;s no need to sit in a waiting room for hours when you&#8217;re already feeling terrible. You can speak to one of our online doctors at home, in bed with a warm cup of tea. Wouldn&#8217;t that be a much better way to spend a sick day?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Maple &#8211; a complement, not a replacement</h2>
<p>Sometimes you just need a quick prescription refill when your family doctor is on vacation. Maybe you&#8217;re running a fever and you&#8217;re in no shape to go out. Or you&#8217;re looking for a second opinion on a diagnosis you&#8217;re not so sure about. Maple has online doctors, available 24/7 to consult with you. There will definitely be situations where you&#8217;ll need to see a physician in person. For everything else? Well, let&#8217;s just say, we&#8217;re here for you.</p>
