										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much of your workforce struggles with </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/how-chronic-pain-impacts-the-workplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chronic illness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a clear idea, you’re not alone. According to a 2020 survey of plan sponsors, employers believe that </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 34%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their employees suffer from a chronic condition. In reality, a staggering 58% of employees actually do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gap may be startling, but the reason it exists is that employees are hesitant to share their health concerns in the workplace. While chronic illnesses are long-term conditions that are a part of an employee&#8217;s daily life, they certainly don’t want to be defined by this in the workplace. That said, chronic conditions like asthma, arthritis, and diabetes can make it difficult for employees to focus on their work due to discomfort, pain, stress, or fatigue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the thing: as an employer, you don’t always need to know the exact chronic health conditions your employees are facing in order to support them. But it is important to put a strategy in place for helping your employees cope and reduce the inherent risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly can your company do? Unlike boosting employee engagement, chronic illness requires a more nuanced and sensitive approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What employees actually need is the support to help themselves. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic illness management is a big problem for employees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (55%) take at least one medication regularly to manage their chronic condition. That’s almost equivalent to the number of employees who report a chronic health condition. At the same time, 43% of these employees report they sometimes don’t take their medication as scheduled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medication adherence issues represent a significant cost burden for employers, </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 36% of overall benefits costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go toward chronic diseases or conditions. Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.medaviebc.ca/en/insights/posts/medication-non-adherence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% to 30% of prescriptions are never filled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and an </span><a href="https://www.medaviebc.ca/en/insights/posts/medication-non-adherence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated 50% of medications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for chronic disease aren’t taken as prescribed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cause for medication adherence issues is forgetfulness. </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-one percent of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who skip doses cite this as the primary reason. And it’s understandable. Life gets busy, and your employees have a lot on their plates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">69% of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with chronic illness say that it’s inconvenient to renew their prescription. While not all of these employees skip their medicine, it’s an indication that there are many hoops to jump through (e.g. booking an appointment, taking time off, waiting to see a doctor, sometimes repeating bloodwork, going to the pharmacy) to get a routine prescription. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52% of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who report skipping medication say this happens about 25% of the time. This is a meaningful figure. The non-adherence threshold – the point when medication starts losing its effectiveness – is 20%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a significant problem, but it has an easy solution. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual care offers a seamless, digital-first solution for chronic illness management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we have something important to do, we tend to remember the need at random moments. If possible, we address it in the moment, but if the tools don’t exist, we put it off until later. Our modern world has made instant solutions possible for all kinds of routine tasks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take banking. If you’ve forgotten to pay a bill, you can log into your online banking app and transfer money with a few keystrokes on your phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees can enjoy a similar digital experience for managing their chronic conditions. By offering a full featured virtual care program as a benefit, you can give your employees the power to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See a doctor in minutes and receive a prescription renewal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consult with a physician to conduct a check-in on a chronic illness, or order labs to check current health status </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with a CDE to learn more about managing diabetes </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick up their prescription at the nearest pharmacy or have it delivered </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access all of their patient notes in one online record</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the positive impact that this can have on your workforce: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reduced absenteeism:</b> <a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of employees say they’ve missed work or struggled to do their job well due to chronic illness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher productivity:</b> <a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of employees say their chronic illness makes it difficult for them to concentrate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Increased employee acquisition and retention:</b> <a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly three-quarters of employers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to add more funding and resources to areas outside of their core health benefit plans. Chronic illness prevention is where 49% of these employers want to focus their attention over the next year. Employers that want to attract – and retain – top talent will need to keep their employee offerings competitive. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your HR team focuses on finding helpful ways to support employees. These solutions have to walk the fine line between respecting your employees’ privacy and being a personalized, accessible solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a digital app like Maple is a smart way to do so when it comes to chronic conditions. With 56% of employees with chronic illness saying they’ve used a mobile device or app to manage their health, it’s worth considering whether a virtual healthcare offering is worth the investment. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of a global health crisis, Canadians feel more vulnerable. They have a stronger desire to protect their loved ones and a growing interest in ensuring they can protect their own health. One way Canadians are doing this is by exploring life insurance as a better way to prepare for the future. Research shows that </span><a href="https://www.insurance-canada.ca/2020/12/23/policyadvisor-survey-canadians-value-life-insurance-more-during-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">64% of Canadians</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">think life insurance is one of the most important types of coverage to have during the pandemic. This belief has led to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an increase in Canadian life insurance applications, particularly </span><a href="https://insurance-portal.ca/article/mib-index-shows-increase-in-canadian-life-insurance-applications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">among people under 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life insurers have been seeking ways to differentiate their offering in an increasingly commoditized market. While the growth of digital channels has streamlined the purchase journey down to a matter of minutes, the life insurance offering and experience after purchase continue to look very much the same – the customer purchases the policy and typically doesn’t engage with the insurer again until renewal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers need more out of their financial products. It’s essential that life insurers consider how to engage their customers with an expanded value proposition at the point of purchase and more regularly thereafter.</span></p>
<h2>Differentiated value to quicken the pace of purchase</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While concerns over mortality risk continue to decline, lifestyle and behaviour-related diseases are on the rise. Canadians are looking for seamless, effective ways to manage their health and well-being. Life insurers can play a key role in leveraging consumer health needs by shifting their sales talk track from financial protection to proactive health management, engaging customers with a relevant offering, and delivering tangible value for their day-to-day needs. </span></p>
<h2>Increased touchpoints to drive loyalty and reduce attrition</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond making policies more attractive to potential clients and boosting customer acquisition, a benefit that creates additional customer touchpoints can help drive loyalty and retention. Today, the lack of ongoing engagement makes it difficult for insurers to identify new ways of helping customers. With access to a service that provides ongoing value, customers will continuously engage with their life insurance provider, helping to reduce policy lapse rate, keeping the life insurance provider top of mind, and providing an immediate advantage for policy maintenance. </span></p>
<h2>Reward customers for healthy behaviours</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping customers better manage their health can lead to long-term benefits beyond customer acquisition and retention. Life insurers can save on payouts and develop targeted health offerings based on aggregate health data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, we’re observing a shift towards rewarding customers for healthy behaviours leading to shared value for the customer, the insurer, and the community. One flagship example is the Vitality program developed by Discovery, a South African insurance company. The program offers customers incentives to engage with their health through gym memberships, discounts on healthy foods, and other rewards. This model unlocks value for all parties — the customer lives a healthier life; the insurer sees reduced claims over time. The Vitality program has shown strong results, demonstrated by 30% lower hospitalization costs and </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/can-insurance-companies-incentivize-their-customers-to-be-healthier"><span style="font-weight: 400;">members living 13 to 21 years longer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the rest of the insured population. Leveraging healthy behaviours to adjust premiums provides a strong incentive for individuals to stay on top of their health, which can help attract new customers or retain current ones.</span></p>
<h2>Personalize the customer experience and adapt the offering</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going beyond the broader demographic approach, life insurance carriers can evolve to more continuous underwriting, using data and connectivity, to personalize offerings. One example includes continuous updates of the product offering based on different life stages, which goes further than mapping out key milestones like a new job or getting married. This requires a strong connection between the insurer, advisor, and the insured to identify what services would be most valuable — whether an insured is travelling, moving to a new city, purchasing a home, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With growing demand for life insurance, an enhanced focus on health and well-being, and increasing savviness within digital channels, life insurance companies have an opportunity to adopt a new narrative and way of thinking to increase customer acquisition and retention. Virtual care is one of many value-added services that can help life insurers shift the focus from financial protection to health and well-being, create a new channel for customer touchpoints, and provide a tailored offering to suit the needs of different segments.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of a COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year was an incredible achievement on the part of the scientific and medical community. While most vaccines take years to formulate and test, 2020 saw two COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that a COVID-19 vaccination campaign is underway across the country, you may be wondering when Canada’s workforce will be able to resume office work. Here are some important elements to consider as your organization prepares for a return to the office.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging from COVID-19 — the year ahead</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, two COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by Health Canada and are now ready for distribution. They come from the pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer. Both vaccines are </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 90% effective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at immunizing against COVID-19. This means that if 100 people were to receive a vaccine, </span><a href="https://qz.com/1930285/what-does-90-percent-effective-mean-for-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fewer than 10 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would contract COVID-19. As for how long immunity lasts, </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/nov-14-covid-vaccine-immune-durability-wallabies-in-the-uk-ancient-female-hunters-and-more-1.5799632/covid-vaccines-are-on-the-horizon-but-how-long-might-protection-last-1.5799649"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no one knows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quite yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company based in the United Kingdom, has also developed a vaccine that’s up to 90% effective. We’re still awaiting its possible approval and rollout in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the arrival of a vaccine signals a turn in the fight against COVID-19, we still have a long way to go before we can reap its benefits as a society. Producing vaccines for millions of Canadians and coordinating delivery and vaccinations will require Herculean, months-long efforts. Moreover, both COVID-19 vaccines require two shots taken a few weeks apart, which adds significant logistical hurdles. The first shot introduces the body to the COVID-19 virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response even more. After vaccination, it typically takes the body a few weeks to reach peak immunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both vaccines also require intense refrigeration. Pfizer’s vaccine must be chilled at minus </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 degrees celsius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while Moderna’s vaccine must be stored at minus 20 degrees celsius. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has a notable advantage — it can be kept in regular refrigerated conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines elicit a fairly broad immune response, so </span><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-20---covid-19---variants-vaccines?gclid=CjwKCAiAmrOBBhA0EiwArn3mfAEHPT51GdNHvgS9JDTiICxw7snCXG9uIlegyHiF7DFP_h0wQRGIShoC2d4QAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experts believe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it’s likely these vaccines will protect people against new variants of the virus. That being said, studies are still being conducted to test the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against these new variants. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When will Canada receive the COVID-19 vaccine?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to government officials, Canada is expected to receive around </span><a href="https://www.680news.com/2021/02/23/pfizer-moderna-executives-expect-covid-19-vaccine-shipments-to-triple-canada/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">six million doses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March. By </span><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/canada-locks-in-20m-more-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-this-spring-1.5263452"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s expected we’ll have procured enough vaccines for everyone in Canada who wants to be immunized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal with vaccination is to immunize enough Canadians to hit and surpass the herd immunity threshold. With herd immunity, if one person is infected with an illness, the virus dies before it can be passed to another non-immune person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there are still questions around what’s needed to achieve herd immunity. Experts believe a high percentage of the population, </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7591374/herd-immunity-covid-19-questions-alberta/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around 85%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will likely need to be immunized before a societal protection can be reached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 vaccination campaign now underway across Canada, organizations have started to plan for a safe return to the office. Here are some important questions for HR teams to consider.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. What will our new work model look like?</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.benefitscanada.com/news/85-of-canadian-workers-want-option-to-keep-working-from-home-after-coronavirus-survey-145839"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 85% of Canadian workers want the option of working from home more frequently once offices reopen and 68% want fewer in-person meetings and training sessions. At the same time, according to </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f31a311d93d0f2e28aaf04a/t/60007f1222541d352a6e1099/1610645269684/MHRC+Covid+Poll+4+National+Report+Final+-+Public+Release.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Health Research Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 36% of Canadians claim that working exclusively from home is negatively impacting their mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a hybrid work model is gaining popularity. This model allows for employees to come to the office when collaboration is needed, and stay home when heads-down work is required. This model puts flexibility first, which many employees have come to appreciate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though working through a pandemic has been a learning experience for employers and employees alike, workers certainly appreciate some newfound efficiencies of working remotely. </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/today-s-issues/upskilling/canadian-pulse-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 35% of remote workers have noted an increase in their productivity while 40% mentioned being equally as productive. Remote workers also save an average of </span><a href="https://resources.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 minutes daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from commuting and exercise </span><a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 minutes more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the workweek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a whole, it’s clear that employees show a growing preference for companies offering flexible work arrangements. Only </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/today-s-issues/upskilling/canadian-pulse-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Canadian workers say they would like to return to the office full-time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. When should we ask employees to return to the office?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of when and how to gradually bring employees back to the office is one of the biggest challenges organizations are facing right now. Some companies, such as Netflix, don’t plan to bring employees back until </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-reed-hastings-deems-remote-work-a-pure-negative-11599487219?mod=djemalertNEWS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of them have been vaccinated. Others, like </span><a href="https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/return-to-the-office-what-these-insurance-executives-say-1004202921/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CAA Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will be bringing back workers gradually, but don’t anticipate having more than 50% of its staff back in the office until at least after the third quarter of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning on asking employees to return to the office before herd immunity has been achieved, make sure to put workers at the heart of your planning process. Protect employees’ health and safety by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining a clean and safe work environment, with a focus on cleaning and disinfecting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging employees to practise good hygiene, including washing their hands often</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring masks or face coverings </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewing your sick leave policy to encourage sick employees to stay home </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redesigning spaces to promote physical distancing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing ventilation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining flexibility for people who are at risk of more severe outcomes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important element to keep in mind is that re-opening the office isn’t about bringing employees back in the same physical location. It’s about developing new models of work that enhance your business while prioritizing your employees’ health and safety. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. What’s our change management strategy?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much has changed since the start of the pandemic. Your employee headcount may have changed during the pandemic, and some employees may have never set foot in the office at all. Naturally, some employees will be worried about their safety – </span><a href="https://www.benefitscanada.com/news/bencan/85-of-canadian-workers-want-option-to-keep-working-from-home-after-coronavirus-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 73% of Canadian workers want better cleaning protocols at their workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To navigate change, communication will be key. You’ll need support employees who are returning to the office as well as those who continue to work remotely. Since online work is different from in-person dynamics, you’ll need some ice-breakers and social activities to help people build or rebuild relationships in the physical world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, you should focus on communicating a vision for the near future that employees can share and embrace. Your change management strategy should also be </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/governance-insights-center/library/covid-19-returning-workplace-boards.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rooted in empathy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acknowledging that everyone has faced unique challenges as a result of this worldwide crisis. You should create a plan for safety policies, answer questions, ask for feedback, and be sensitive to your staff’s diverse situations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering personalized mental health support during this period could also be a valuable initiative. Change is never easy, and online therapy provides a flexible solution that employees can access quickly when they’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re almost there</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light at the end of the tunnel is finally visible, however distant it may still feel. Now’s the perfect opportunity to rethink how employees work at the office, and develop new and innovative ways of working and being productive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for new ways to support your employees’ physical and mental well-being during this period of change, get in touch. We can discuss adding virtual healthcare to your benefits program to help your team stay safe, healthy, and productive. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October is small business month. It’s a time to reflect on how small businesses are truly the backbones of our communities, and Canada’s economy. There are over 1.2 million small businesses in Canada. They represent 98% of Canada’s businesses, and they’re at dire risk from the circumstances of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have reported more COVID-19 related losses than medium or large businesses. They’ve seen greater revenue dips than larger companies, and have had to lay off more staff. Nearly every small business owner has wondered if they’ll be able to weather the COVID-19 storm, or if permanent closure would be the better option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a small business, there’s no clear roadmap for how to navigate the ongoing challenges. As with all things COVID-19, resources are dispersed across the internet, and sensible advice comes second after reactionary headlines. The following tips come from financial and business experts. They may not be a perfect fit for your business, but they should shed some insight on the pockets of opportunity in this new landscape. </span></p>
<h2>1. Take stock of your finances</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with all large-scale endeavours, it’s important to understand your current standing and resources before making new decisions. Create a COVID-19 costs and balance sheet, totalling your financial reserves and recurring expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are advised to have six months of cash stowed away for times of emergency. This would certainly be one of those times. Unfortunately, it’s difficult for small businesses to amass that much reserves. Even larger businesses struggle to meet that target. It’s one of the reasons small businesses have taken a harder hit from COVID-19. They tend not to have the financial safety net to withstand a series of low-revenue months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve surmised your financial situation, look for programs and grants to lower your costs. A few ways to start are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-negotiating your rent with your landlord.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to your bank about what relief programs are available for small businesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit the </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government of Canada website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see what wage subsidy programs you’re eligible for. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://betakit.com/heres-how-cdntech-companies-are-pitching-in-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapping into Canada’s startup network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for free business and technology services. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time for tough decisions. Scrutinize every business cost on your balance sheet. Trim anything that isn’t necessary right now. Look for which products and services make the most money for you. Those are your profit centres. Carry more of those profit centre items, promote them through advertising, and focus your business around what’s moving the most units.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Go digital</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can your business sell its inventory online? Can it offer classes or consultations over video conference? Is there a way for customers to financially support you online? If there’s any way to move your business over to digital, do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts project the in-person economy will take years to revert to pre-coronavirus levels. In the meantime, customers are living more of their lives and doing more of their shopping on the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some impactful ways to start your online business presence:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a website. You don’t need to have any coding knowledge to create a professional-looking website. There are website-building services like </span><a href="http://wix.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://squarespace.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that make it easy to create sleek and modern sites.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create content for social media. Customers engage with brands over platforms like Instagram and Facebook. If your business is in the consumer-goods space, you can set up aesthetically-pleasing photoshoots that are likely to gain traction on visually-oriented social media platforms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start email marketing. Email is one of the most effective ways to communicate with your customers, and it doesn’t have to cost a thing. There are many </span><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/free-email-marketing-tools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free bulk email sending tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, you’ll get more power and functionality from a paid plan. You can use email to communicate about promotions, send out useful content, and keep customers updated as to re-opening plans and policies.   </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts estimate that the pandemic has advanced the online and e-commerce economy by 10 years. If anything is “hot” right now, it’s online shopping and services. While an online business may not replace the magic of in-person community, it’s a great way to keep revenue coming in. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Create a safe environment for employees and customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rebound of our economy will depend on how confident customers feel returning to public spaces. Experts project it will take years for Canadians to feel fully confident shopping and living as they did before. The best thing you can do to speed this process along is to lead by example when it comes to safety procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an investment in community health, and in customers’ perception of your business. Stock up on hand sanitizer, face masks, plexiglass dividers, and physical distancing floor markers. Put posters up communicating your stringent safety measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the same token, your employees need to feel comfortable returning to work. You’re likely running on a lean staff count right now, and the short or long-term absence of any employee will be deeply felt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let employees ask whatever questions they need to, and provide direct, honest answers. Introduce safety policies like face masks, frequent hand-washing, and temperature checks. </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/six-tips-for-bringing-your-staff-back-to-the-office-safely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a good starting plan for bringing employees back to your workplace safely.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a good idea to offer more employee health resources, such as more days off, and enhanced health benefits. Virtual care is a terrific benefit to offer as it gives employees a direct connection to a doctor, 24/7. They can attend to any health concerns without missing out on work, feeling safer and supported. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Encourage Canadians to shop local</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone should take note of this tip — now is the time to support small businesses with your dollars. If and when you can, choose your local small businesses to shop for quarantine essentials and holiday gifts. $30 doesn’t mean much to a big multi-national corporation, but a few $30 purchases could mean the world to a small business’s survival. Encourage local shopping on social media, with posters in your shop windows, and through word-of-mouth. It’s a good reminder to everyone that shopping isn’t just about convenience. It’s also about supporting the businesses that we love to see thriving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no ordinary small business month. We commend the small businesses who’ve been persevering through these exceptional times. It will be a beautiful sight when small businesses are all fully-operational, and people are shopping freely. Until then, small businesses are doing what they’re best at — coming up with ingenuitive solutions based on their resources at-hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in offering virtual care for your employees, we’ve launched our new Smart Business Health Plan. This is our lowest-priced plan, giving you the core benefits of a virtual care program without extra administrative costs. Get in touch if you’d like to know more. We’re happy to support small businesses with accessible healthcare to keep employees, and operations healthy. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Many Canadians get their annual flu shot at mobile clinics at their workplace. This year, with so many  people working from home, is different. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the seasonal flu is the most of our health worries come fall and wintertime. This year is different. It’s more important than ever that Canadians get their flu shot. But where should you go for a flu shot if you’re working from home?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flu shot is a vaccine that’s redeveloped every year to protect against different variations of influenza, which are called strains. Scientists predict which strains will be the most common during the upcoming flu season, and include them in the vaccine that’s administered to the public. Don’t worry — the flu shot only contains dead or weak samples of each strain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many employers set up temporary flu shot clinics at their offices. That is, of course, when offices are open. With many people still working from home, they’ll have to find other ways to get the flu shot this year. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is getting a flu shot important?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flu is serious business. It can put you on the sidelines for weeks recovering, and lead to severe medical complications. In Canada, the seasonal flu </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/health-professionals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is responsible for approximately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you sail through recovery just fine, getting the flu shot is still important for protecting people who are at higher risk for complications. This group includes senior citizens, those with underlying health conditions, young children, and pregnant women. When you get the flu shot, you’re at lower risk of spreading the flu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t an ordinary year for the flu due to COVID-19. Experts say that it’s doubly important to get the flu shot this year. By getting the flu shot, you’ll be able to discern whether illness symptoms that pop up are related to the seasonal flu or COVID-19. If you’ve already had the flu shot, any onset of fever and dry cough are more likely to signal COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the strain on our healthcare system, which we should always keep in mind. If there’s another spike in COVID-19 cases, we’ll need to ensure there are enough empty hospital beds to accommodate new patients. If we’re also dealing with a heavy flu season at that time, we run the risk of overrunning our hospitals.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s even more worrying, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213830/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there have been cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of patients getting the seasonal flu and COVID-19 at the same time. The common theme with COVID-19 is uncertainty. We don’t know what to expect when people get both diseases. It’s better not to experiment with your health, so get your flu shot. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where can you get the flu shot during COVID-19?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmacies </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In normal years, approximately 35% of flu shots are given at local pharmacies. That figure is expected to rise this year as doctor’s clinics may not be able to accommodate so many patients. </span><a href="https://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/health-and-pharmacy/pharmacy-services/flu-shot"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers Drug Mart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a mailing list to notify you when the flu shot is ready. You’ll even get 500 Optimum points for signing up.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctor’s clinics</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your family doctor or local walk-in clinic can give you the flu shot once it’s been distributed to your province. This year, with physical distancing, clinics will probably schedule flu shot appointments to avoid having too many people sitting in their waiting rooms. That might mean that clinics won’t be able to give the flu shot to as many patients as usual. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public health clinics </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Canadian towns and cities have public clinics for matters like sexual health, harm reduction, and primary health for lower-income people. You can get the flu shot at many of these clinics, but it’s a good idea to call ahead first to confirm they’re offering the vaccine. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offices </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your employer has reopened their office space, they may set up a mobile flu shot clinic this year. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should you get the flu shot?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Public Health Agency of Canada has stated the flu shot should be ready at its normal time this year, late September to early October. You should get the flu shot as early as possible once it’s available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about two weeks for your body to create antibodies to fight the flu once you’ve received the vaccine. Flu season is well underway by November, so you’ll want your antibodies going at full strength by then. The flu season peaks in January or February. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it safe to get the flu shot during COVID-19?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a word, yes. The flu shot does not put you at higher risk of contracting either COVID-19, or the seasonal flu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines are specific in their effects. If this weren’t the case, we would have one vaccine for all respiratory diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what if the vaccine for COVID-19 is miraculously developed, tested, and ready for the public this flu season? You can still get both vaccines. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety precautions for getting the flu shot during COVID-19</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect that medical staff will be wearing plenty of personal protective equipment when you go get your flu shot. You should do the same and wear a face mask, use hand sanitizer regularly, and maintain physical distance from staff and other patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before getting your flu shot. If you have a fever, or may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, you may be asked to come back after self-quarantining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babies under six months old are too young for the flu shot. Kids over six months are great candidates though. That’s because kids are “super-spreaders” of the flu. By inoculating kids, that’s a big step towards preventing the flu from spreading through communities. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have questions about getting the flu shot?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want some good news for a change? Flu numbers are at record lows this year. That’s because our collective measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have also helped prevent the flu from spreading. Washing our hands, wearing face masks, and physical distancing are useful for slowing the spread of most diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t take that as a green light to skip your flu shot. It’s an easy and effective way to help keep Canada healthy as we enter into the chilly fall and winter seasons. How we cope with the fall and winter seasons will set us up for ultimate recovery from COVID-19. Let’s keep going strong. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The "new normal" we're living in has made it difficult for most businesses and employees to operate at full force. Virtual care can help.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most competitive businesses rely on finely-tuned processes driven by a healthy and happy workforce. Without competitive healthcare benefits, it’s hard to create a winning workplace where talent can flourish. After all, </span><a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-US/insights/2018/08/employee-and-employer-satisfaction-with-group-benefit-marketplaces-survey-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of employees report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they’re more likely to stick around for the long haul if their employers offer comprehensive health benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a strong workplace culture starts with investing in the health of your employees. This includes telemedicine, or “virtual care” coverage. With social distancing mandates in effect, it’s crucial that your employees receive the care they need while minimizing their exposure to others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is only one of the many benefits that come with investing in t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">elemedicine benefits for your employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ve listed some of the other top reasons to offer virtual care below.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthening company culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health and wellness are at the heart of thriving workplace cultures. When your employees feel safe, healthy, and supported, they perform better at work. On average, employees who have comprehensive health benefits, including virtual care, are </span><a href="http://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/documents/resources-whitepapers-health-and-well-being.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11% more engaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at work than those who don’t. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring safety and social distancing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the arrival of COVID-19, virtual care is changing the way primary care is delivered. Maintaining distance is a critical factor for providing safe and effective healthcare services in this “new normal.” Virtual care also reduces the strain of patient demand on healthcare facilities and limits potential infection exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually doctor’s offices are thought of as safe places. Today, many patients feel apprehensive about visiting a doctor in-person for care not related to COVID-19. Fortunately, virtual care lets patients receive the care they need from the comfort of their homes without jeopardizing their safety.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible mental healthcare</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life."><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in every five</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Canadian adults will experience a mental health or substance abuse problem in any given year. This leads to over </span><a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life."><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000 employed Canadians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> missing work every week due to mental health-related disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine has workplace mental health benefits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well.  Virtual psychotherapy, psychiatry, and other services open up mental healthcare to those who otherwise don’t have time or local providers. Patients can speak with therapists via text or video to receive the therapy they need. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support a remote workforce</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular. Recent reports show that many Canadians are now working remotely from cottages and rural locations more than ever. For some remote employees, seeing a physician means driving hours to the nearest town. Thanks to virtual care, those working from remote locations can access the care they need even if local options are scarce. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee absenteeism with telemedicine</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, employee absenteeism </span><a href="https://www.sunlife.ca/static/canada/Sponsor/About%20Group%20Benefits/Focus%20Update/2013/Special%20Edition%20-%20Sept.%2023%20-%20%20Sun%20Life%20co-sponsors%20major%20new%20Conference%20Board%20of/MissinginAction_SUN%20LIFE_EN.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs over $16 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually. This loss translates, on average, to nine days of forfeited productivity per employee. A typical Canadian company will lose over $2,000 per employee every year to employee absences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often not possible to schedule a same-day doctor’s appointment in person. Since up to </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2012/07/24/pros-and-cons-of-telemedicine-for-todays-workers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of doctor visits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be handled remotely, telemedicine lets employees quickly address their health issues without taking time off work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your business’s competitiveness</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s proven that fully-trained employees are more productive and bring greater monetary value than newer employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine has employee retention benefits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since the majority of workers state that health benefits are a major factor when it comes to job satisfaction. For the most in-demand candidates, they can afford to be even choosier. Offering virtual care</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a competitive advantage for employers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looking to put together teams that contain the best available talent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empower a productive workforce</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business is only as healthy as its employees. When your team has better access to care, studies show that teams enjoy a healthy boost in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">productivity from workplace telemedicine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lost productivity due to suboptimal health costs over </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3128441/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$260 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually. Recently, a study found that teams with one worker suffering depression are </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316753097_Mental_Health_and_Productivity_at_Work_Does_What_You_Do_Matter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5% less productive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a whole than healthy teams. A five percent difference in productivity can make a world of difference for a company’s bottom line. If you want to boost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">workplace performance, telemedicine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great place to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy employees can focus on their jobs instead of worrying about managing symptoms they’re dealing with. Virtual care lets employees see a physician faster and with fewer barriers, so employees can get back to their jobs quicker and feel better. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost work-life balance and employee satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual care cuts out the time spent transiting to and from a doctor’s office, and prescriptions can be delivered right to patients’ doorsteps. Employees with virtual care coverage can optimize their schedules to visit a doctor when it’s convenient for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual care also boosts work-life balance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by freeing up time for employees to take care of more rewarding tasks. Taking the dog for a walk, one-on-one time with kids, or a rejuvenating meditation session are more fulfilling uses of time than sitting in a waiting room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is a happier, healthier team. A recent Ipsos poll </span><a href="https://www.lifehealthpro.ca/news/virtual-care-vital-to-employee-satisfaction-rbc-insurance-325268.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that 72% of Canadians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would view their employer more positively if they were offered telemedicine benefits. This is especially true of young employees aged 18 to 34 years old, who rank lowest in job satisfaction and mental health. Among this demographic, 78% say they would view their employer more positively if given telemedicine benefits.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a workplace innovator, invest in telemedicine</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exceptional times we’re living in have underscored the need for telemedicine. Social distance mandates have made virtual care imperative for businesses that want to protect the health and safety of their employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual care benefits both employers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and employees, as well as our broader communities as we work to finally quell COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, studies show employee satisfaction is highest in companies that prioritize the health, well-being, and freedom of their workers. Telemedicine does just that by providing employees with fast, effective care on their own terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for ways to support the health of your workforce? Get in touch. We’ve helped many organizations create customized plans to meet the unique needs of their staff. The future of both work and healthcare are about accessibility and flexibility. We’re here to provide support. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada’s population is aging. </span><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-215-x/2019001/sec2-eng.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Statistics Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2019, 34.3% of the population was over the age of 53 compared to 23.7% in 1999. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing number of older adults presents many challenges for the Canadian healthcare system. For example, </span><a href="https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/canadas-aging-population-is-going-to-put-a-strain-on-government-coffers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare costs are expected to increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 57% by 2045. This means </span><a href="https://www.cma.ca/sites/default/files/2018-11/CMA_Policy_Health_and_Health_Care_for_an_Aging-Population_PD14-03-e_0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the demand for health services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will continue to increase. Fortunately, technology provides valuable solutions to meet these challenges, allowing seniors to stay healthy and active well past retirement age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most significant ways technology helps seniors gain access to healthcare.</span></p>
<h2>Medication management</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As people age, they tend to rely more on medications to manage various health problems. Medication management mobile applications and pill dispensers can help seniors follow the right schedule. By prompting Canadians to take the correct doses at the right time, technology can facilitate medication adherence. While it may not seem like a big problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">medication non-adherence accounts for five percent of Canadian hospital admissions and five percent of physician visits. Combined, these result in an additional </span><a href="https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/what-we-do/blog/medication-management/7874-medication-non-adherence-exploring-the-tension-between-patient-safety-and-patient-autonomy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4 billion in healthcare costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many medication management applications also send reminders when it&#8217;s time to refill a prescription. This helps patients avoid running out of medication. Some applications designed for the family&#8217;s peace of mind can even track the number of pills taken from a pill bottle.</span></p>
<h2>Fall prevention and medical alert systems</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For seniors, falls can have disastrous health consequences. What if they’re alone and can’t get back up? Modern medical alert systems use GPS, fall detection, and geofencing technology to help locate seniors and provide assistance as quickly as possible. For example, in North America, the </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208944"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now comes with a heart monitor and a fall detection system. These functionalities are already saving lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in a medical alert system but aren’t sure which features are important, consider getting a device that’s waterproof so that it can be worn while taking a shower or a bath. The tub is an obvious place where someone can slip and fall. One study shows that falls in the bathroom were </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700929/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than twice as likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to result in an injury compared to falls in the living room.</span></p>
<h2>Telemedicine</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine allows physicians to visit their patients remotely using video conference. This service can have a highly positive impact on the health of older adults. Many </span><a href="https://www.mcmasterforum.org/docs/default-source/product-documents/evidence-briefs/care-systems-for-older-adults-in-ontario-eb.pdf?sfvrsn=ff5455d5_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommend using telehealth to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and service use. Simply put, virtual care saves time and allows health providers to see more patients. It also drastically reduces costs, including traveling and missed visits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients tried virtual care services for the first time. </span><a href="https://www.bettermedicarealliance.org/news/poll-seniors-give-telehealth-high-marks-medicare-advantage-satisfaction-smashes-new-record/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scientific survey of 2000 seniors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Morning Consult found that 91 percent of patients who used telehealth services reported favourable experiences. </span><a href="http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/care-anywhere-moving-healthcare-closer-to-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by Accenture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on a community in Spain where one in five older patients received access to telemedicine. The study concluded that virtual visits significantly decreased the number of hospital visits. This saved the community an estimated $55 million in just one year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term care is a sector of the healthcare system in which reliable and timely access to physicians is a growing problem. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this issue. To provide access to care to those who need it, Maple powers a program in partnership with a Canadian hospital to bring 24/7 specialty care into long-term care homes. The early results are very promising, as more than 100 emergency department and hospital transfers were avoided in the first three months. These high-risk events often lead to complications as well as significant financial costs for the healthcare system.</span></p>
<h2>Encouraging technology adoption among senior citizens</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some older adults still hesitate to embrace technology. This is often due to a lack of comfort or confidence in using devices, or frustrations that can arise when learning to use them. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/04/03/older-adults-and-technology-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Pew Research claimed that 77% of seniors indicated they would need help learning new technologies. Unfortunately, many seniors dislike asking for help. They fear looking foolish, being talked down to, or being seen as a nuisance. On the other hand, the same survey showed that once seniors feel comfortable with technology, they are often highly engaged daily users. By receiving better hands-on education and support, older adults can get more out of technology and enjoy happier, longer lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors in Canada who need help with technology can check out </span><a href="https://www.techserveto.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechServeTo</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The organization&#8217;s team of volunteers provide free tech support to older adults across Canada. Another option is </span><a href="https://www.seniorstechservices.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors Tech Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides computer training for an hourly fee.</span></p>
<h2>Innovation in senior care</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From fall prevention to medication management to telemedicine, technology powers the future of preventative healthcare for seniors. Adopting digital health solutions today can improve access to care, reduce costs, and empower senior residents. It can also pave the way for future innovations. Moreover, experts in aging often emphasize the importance of </span><a href="https://caph.org/priorities/medi-cal-2020-waiver/whole-person-care/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“whole person” care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rather than purely just treating clinical symptoms. Technology solutions are highly compatible with this approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Canada, new technologies and innovations are making an impact on the health of older adults. Moving forward, we can expect the landscape for senior care to continue to evolve. Emerging technologies like wearables, smart homes, voice interfaces, robots, and autonomous vehicles all show promise for senior care. This is why it’s so important to provide education and help seniors become more comfortable with technology. It could have positive benefits for Canada’s population for years to come. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Employees are juggling all sorts of challenges right now, and they need a benefits plan that accounts for their new normal. Virtual care is a solution.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/2020/09/15/why-you-need-to-rethink-your-health-benefits-package/">Why you need to rethink your health benefits package</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getmaple.ca">Maple</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health and wellness have been at the centre of the world’s attention since the start of COVID-19. That’s why now more than ever, workplaces need a robust health benefits program to remain competitive. </span><a href="https://www.metlife.com/employee-benefit-trends/ebts-experience-human-workplace-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 58% of job seekers favour a diverse workplace benefits package that they can tailor to their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a health benefits program that meets today’s new standard might seem daunting. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to supporting employee health. The recent surge in virtual care shows that remote access to care lets employees prioritize what’s best for them and their families. By offering virtual care, employers remain competitive while putting the well-being of their staff first.</span></p>
<h2>Healthcare from anywhere is the new standard</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of people have accessed virtual care for the first time in recent months. </span><a href="https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two thirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of primary care visits in Canada have happened virtually since COVID-19 emergency measures began. As physical distancing lightens, not everyone will be comfortable resuming in-person doctor’s appointments again. Employers can support their staff by offering virtual care to facilitate routine checkups, mental health, and chronic care appointments. Plus, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of Canadians</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were willing to trade their current health benefits for digital tools like virtual care even before the pandemic.  </span></p>
<h2>Families need access to healthcare outside of business hours</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home has its benefits and challenges for employees. Especially for parents, balancing meetings and childcare is an ever-present juggling act. People need access to medical appointments outside of typical business hours in order to accommodate their hectic schedules. </span><a href="https://risepeople.com/blog/fascinating-benefits-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 47% of employees are looking for benefits that adapt to new family living structures. Adding virtual care to your health benefits package gives the caregivers on your team the power to book checkups at any time.</span></p>
<h2>Improved access to mental health therapy improves your bottom line</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-health-and-covid-19/covid-19-national-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 19% of Canadians have felt increased anxiety during COVID-19. Nearly the same amount feel depressed. In one year alone, mental illness has cost Canadian employers over </span><a href="https://www.mentalhealthcommission.ca/English/what-we-do/workplace#:~:text=The%20total%20cost%20from%20mental,from%20absenteeism%2C%20presenteeism%20and%20turnover."><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in absenteeism and turnover. With a modern benefits plan, employees get to choose the type of mental health treatment they need the most. Virtual care provides customizable support to employees as they navigate the unpredictable, long-term mental health effects of this challenging time. </span></p>
<h2>Employees are loyal to employers who offer a quality benefits program</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers between work and home have never been thinner. Showing a renewed interest in your team’s health is one way to strengthen your team’s connection. In fact, </span><a href="https://risepeople.com/blog/fascinating-benefits-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">59% of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say that health and wellness benefits are important for increasing loyalty to their employer. Encouraging staff to prioritize their health amid today’s challenges sends the message that they’re valued. </span></p>
<h2>Offering virtual care signals that you’re future-proof</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During periods of uncertainty, talent will understandably gravitate towards businesses that are demonstrating agility. This provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen employee retention and attract new talent. How? By showing your business is thinking about its </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2020/05/31/6-ways-you-can-future-proof-your-business-for-a-post-pandemic-workplace/#1a2dae8a2046"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-term plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As remote-first work arrangements look like they’re here to stay, digital health options are great tools for keeping team members healthy wherever they are. Virtual care options make for a standout employment perk, and shows your company&#8217;s leadership is preparing for whatever the future holds.</span></p>
<h2>Remote healthcare professionals fill gaps in community needs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical professionals across the country have served as the backbone of emergency relief efforts during COVID-19. For some healthcare professionals, this required shifting their attention from their normal roster of patients to caring for patients with COVID-19. This has made it more difficult for people to access primary care within their community. With a benefits package that includes access to virtual care, no employee needs to experience care interruptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future is full of uncertainty for both businesses and employees, but it’s also full of opportunity. Staying competitive, compassionate, and cooperative as your team adapts to this challenging time makes a strong statement. Updating your employee health benefits package is a simple entry point to becoming a trailblazer business. By offering access to remote healthcare, you’re making an investment in your team that will have myriad benefits down the line. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplaces play an essential role in nurturing positive mental health. Most adults spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. Because of COVID-19, many people are still adjusting to working remotely from home. Spending a lot of time in the same environment while not seeing colleagues in person every day can take its toll on mental health. A stressful or taxing work environment can also contribute to the rise of mental health problems, which in turn has serious economic repercussions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://canadasafetycouncil.org/mental-health-and-the-workplace/#:~:text=Mental%20health%20claims%20are%20the,Canada's%20major%20insurers%20and%20employers."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Safety Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mental health claims are the fastest growing category of disability costs in Canada. Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e economic burden of mental health problems in Canada is estimated at </span><a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life."><span style="font-weight: 400;">$51 billion per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes healthcare costs, lost productivity, absenteeism, and reductions in quality of life. </span></p>
<h2>Mental health barriers in the workplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health includes an employee’s psychological, emotional, and social well-being. It affects how a person makes choices, relates to others, handles stress, and much more. Just like physical health, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health affects everyone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect an employee’s mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a caring, safe, and healthy workplace culture that’s free of excessive mental stress, an organization&#8217;s commitment has to start at the top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mphasizing that mental health is just as important as physical health can go a long way and help reduce stigma in the workplace. Other ways you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a positive impact on mental health include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promoting work-life balance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging respectful behaviours, with a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing workloads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having conflict resolution practices in place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing employees&#8217; contributions effectively.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health still carries a stigma in the workplace and broader society. This often results in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees becoming fearful of being shamed or discriminated against if they come forward to speak to their manager about what’s affecting them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering mental health educational resources and support can make a big difference. Organizations should let their employees know that it’s not a weakness to admit they’re experiencing mental health issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For employees to feel comfortable speaking up, they need to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a positive relationship with a supportive manager. If an employee believes mental health is looked down upon in the organization, they will be less likely to risk being vulnerable. It’s important to educate your managers on how to address and talk to their employees about mental health issues, to let employees know that mental health issues will be treated with compassion.</span></p>
<h2>Signs and symptoms of mental health distress</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health distress can differ from person to person, making it difficult for employers to recognize symptoms in employees. In any given year, </span><a href="https://cmha.ca/fast-facts-about-mental-illness"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five people in Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally experience a mental health problem or illness. Be aware of some of the common signs, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling sad or down</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood changes, with more highs and more lows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced ability to concentrate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive fears or worries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme feelings of guilt</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdrawal from friends and activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low energy or problems sleeping</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties coping with daily problems or stress</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in eating habits</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be hard for employees to recognize that they’re experiencing mental health distress as it starts to feel familiar, or even normal. It’s important to communicate often about common signs and symptoms, and provide education around mental health to help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees more easily recognize their symptoms. </span></p>
<h2>Why virtual care is a game changer for mental health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With virtual care, employees can speak with a therapist from anywhere. They can schedule an appointment at a time that’s convenient for them or speak with someone as soon as possible. This flexibility removes friction when employees decide to seek help, making it easier to treat mental health problems affecting their performance at work or life at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world continues to adapt to remote working arrangements, telemedicine is well-positioned to support employees regardless of their location. Telemedicine provides access to a wide range of therapists and eliminates many barriers allowing for an efficient and convenient way to access the help they need without fearing judgment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in adding virtual care to your employee benefits package, or if you’d like more information about online counselling, get in touch.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a top-tier company culture starts with the simple truth — invest in people. A team that is healthy, happy, and secure operates like a well oiled machine. People are more content to work for a company that truly cares about their well-being. Whatever your company goals are, they’ll be accelerated by an engaged and healthy workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has brought the topic of Canadians’ health to the forefront. We’ve seen the inextricable link between the health of the greater populace and business’s ability to stay afloat. The economy has changed, certainly in the short term, and very likely in the long term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Canadian businesses re-open and employees return to the office, health is on top of everyone’s minds. In addition to keeping workers safe, employers are wondering how they can create a culture that maximizes health. To this end, an exploding trend is for companies to reexamine, or create from scratch, their corporate healthcare and wellness strategy. </span></p>
<h2>What is a corporate wellness strategy, and why is it important?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A corporate wellness strategy, usually overseen by a company’s human resources department, is a series of goals and tracking milestones aimed to improve employee satisfaction ratings and lower business overhead. </span></p>
<h3>Absenteeism</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee absenteeism, more plainly known as sick days, cost employers around $2,000 per employee each year. It’s natural that employees would need to take a few days off if they’ve come down with the flu or undergone a major surgery. What many employers are finding, however, is that chronic health problems, mental stress, and preventable health episodes are driving more and more worker absenteeism. </span></p>
<h3>Fight disengagement</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving a company’s wellness culture brings intangible benefits that add up to be hugely valuable over the long run. The pervading office culture is a company’s internal brand. A company that makes its employees feel healthy, safe, and valued in turn receives workers who are highly engaged. On the flipside, employee disengagement costs companies huge. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlynborysenko/2019/05/02/how-much-are-your-disengaged-employees-costing-you/#25aa76983437"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to one poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disengaged workers have 37% higher absenteeism rates, are 18% less productive, and are 15% less profitable. </span></p>
<h3>Attract and retain talent</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fantastic health and wellness strategy is a huge differentiator for your company when attempting to attract and retain top talent. </span><a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d7deb342-3775-4e2f-ae9b-05e07decd318/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200703%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200703T131557Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=19837356b57f3c40055d8787433f07f7e18d355dc69785778e9a5ea8b7c91789&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">86% of survey respondents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say that wellness culture is an important factor when deciding whether to accept a job offer, or to stay at their current job. Highly skilled workers can afford to be choosy when shopping multiple job offers, and will often select the company that seems the best fit for their overall lifestyle.</span></p>
<h3>Avoid an employee skills gap</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that want to be competitive in their market need a highly competitive workforce. Conversely, companies that uphold a revolving door culture will find their employee skill level permanently stunted. This is known as the employee skills gap, and it occurs when employees leave a job before they’re fully trained and productive. Since it takes most employees 1-2 years to be firing on all cylinders in their job, high turnover means that companies will always be lagging behind and relying on stressed, under-performing employees. A revolving door culture tends to emerge when a company neglects the well-being of it’s workers, or fails to keep pace with the industry standard for overall culture and compensation.</span></p>
<h2>How to create a corporate wellness strategy</h2>
<h3>1. Set goals</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most successful corporate healthcare and wellness strategies start with clear objectives. To make sure that the strategy gains widespread acceptance and adherence, make it tied to business goals. Top-level company KPIs should incorporate employee wellness objectives. For example, what is the average score for employee workplace satisfaction? What are employee retention rates? Showing employees that culture and well-being are high priorities will create a positive trickle down effect throughout your company. </span></p>
<h3>2. Identify challenges</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What current factors are at play that are lowering the wellness of your workplace? Are there strained relationships, overloading of work, or lack of healthy food options? After setting goals, identify the challenges that made those goals necessities. </span></p>
<h3>3. Choose one or two opportunities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to boil the ocean in your first attempt at a corporate wellness strategy. Rather than looking to heal the whole office, choose a couple high-importance areas to focus on. You’ll be able to track results and make progress against one or two well-selected goals. </span></p>
<h3>4. Create a plan of action</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After choosing your highest priority goals and identifying your challenges, carve out a plan of action to tackle them. Say you want to improve absenteeism rates. Your plan of action might include collecting data about current absenteeism rates, identifying the main reasons behind time off, and taking clear steps to address those reasons. </span></p>
<h3>5. Create an initial benchmark score</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To measure whether your corporate wellness plan is working, you must be measuring against an established benchmark. Otherwise, you’ll have no idea whether things are improving or degrading. You can create a benchmark by surveying your employees, and looking at company data related to your wellness goals. If surveying your employees, make questions detailed so that answers will be as close to objective as possible. Giving vague questions like “How satisfied are you with your job?” are subject to an employee’s broad judgement. Questions like “I feel stressed at least one day each week” are more specific and telling. </span></p>
<h3>6. Carve out time</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main factor that puts corporate wellness plans on hold is lack of time given towards the project. This stems from leadership attitudes that employee wellbeing is not as valuable as initiatives that are tied to immediate monetary gain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness strategy leaders must be deliberate in how they allot their time to ensure health goals are pushed forward. Tying wellness goals into top-level company KPIs is a great way to state that employee wellness is a company mandate, and to remind leadership that a wellness culture is innately tied to a business’s success. </span></p>
<h2>Things to keep in mind when creating a wellness strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mental health<b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real/mental-health-statistics#:~:text=Costs%20to%20society,health%2Drelated%20quality%20of%20life."><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Canadians will experience a mental illness or addiction problem in any given year. Young workers, under 34 years old, report higher levels of stress than their older counterparts. </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/psychotherapist-counselling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows people to see a therapist from the comfort of their home, on whatever schedule suits them best. </span></b></li>
<li>Chronic illness<b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/chronic-diseases/prevalence-canadian-adults-infographic-2019.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">44% of Canadians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above age 20 are reported to have at least one chronic illness. These types of illnesses often require frequent doctor’s appointments and a long term medication schedule. </span></b></li>
<li>Preventative healthcare <span style="font-weight: 400;">— for Canadians under 75 years old, </span><a href="https://yourhealthsystem.cihi.ca/hsp/inbrief.#!/indicators/012/avoidable-deaths/;mapC1;mapLevel2;/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in four deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are due to preventable causes. Including preventative and lifestyle health into your wellness strategy can help your workers live longer and healthier lives. </span></li>
<li>Workers prefer flexibility <span style="font-weight: 400;">— “old school” working arrangements have long fallen out of favour. Employees prefer flexibility in their working life, from work-from-home schedules, flexible start or ends to the day, and customizable health benefits plans. </span></li>
<li>Take advantage of technology <span style="font-weight: 400;">— employees, especially those of the younger generations, are widely open to using technology health tools. </span><a href="https://www.sanofi.ca/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/Websites/North-America/Sanofi-CA/Home/en/Products-and-Resources/sanofi-canada-health-survey/sanofi-canada-healthcare-survey-2020-EN.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=F1C763AA6B2F32C0BF2E623851FD05FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under 34 indicated in one survey that they would use health technology. From health and fitness wearable trackers, to diet and nutrition apps, to virtual doctor’s appointments, technology offers convenient and personal health options.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in employee health is like watering a garden — after some time and attention, everything starts to bloom. A workplace wellness culture makes employees feel more secure and emotionally invested, which results in higher productivity and a more competitive workforce.</span></p>
