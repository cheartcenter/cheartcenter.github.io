]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone knows that there is no such thing as safe alcohol consumption when you’re pregnant. But when it comes to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol and <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/lactation-specialist/">breastfeeding</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what are the rules? Maybe you’ve heard that it’s ok as long as you pump and dump? Or that as long as you stick to beer it’s actually beneficial to the breastfeeding process? There’s a ton of conflicting and downright bad advice out there. So sit tight, and let us break down the facts.</span></p>
<h2>Can I drink alcohol if I’m breastfeeding?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that while breastfeeding parents shouldn’t drink, </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/alcohol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one drink a day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t known to be harmful. The Australian Breastfeeding Association, in contrast, says that </span><a href="https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/sites/default/files/imce/ABA_Alchohol_BF%20for%20website.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three or more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drinks is harmful. So if major organizations can’t give a clear answer, what’s the average mom supposed to do? The short answer is to err on the side of caution, because the effects of alcohol are hard to measure. So yes, you can have an alcoholic drink if you are breastfeeding, but under specific circumstances.</span></p>
<h2>Measuring alcohol intake</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re sober enough to drive, you’re sober enough to breastfeed,” might sound like good advice but objectively measuring your own sobriety can be difficult. Numerous factors affect your body’s ability to process alcohol, from your weight to what you’ve eaten to your sex. Women, for example, are typically more affected by alcohol than men. This occurs because they have a higher proportion of fatty tissue in their bodies, as well as fewer </span><a href="https://alcohol.stanford.edu/alcohol-drug-info/buzz-buzz/factors-affect-how-alcohol-absorbed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol-metabolizing enzymes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than men do. So even if a man and a woman weigh the same, she will likely become intoxicated more quickly from the same amount of alcohol than he will. As well, the effects of alcohol are influenced by </span><a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tolerance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While you may have been a three-glasses-of-wine-a-day gal before your little one was born, nine months of sobriety might mean that half a beer leaves your head spinning these days. Your best bet is to drink in moderation.</span></p>
<h2>How long after drinking can I breastfeed again?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the CDC says that breastfeeding about two hours after having a drink should be fine, you may be better off using a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">breastfeeding and alcohol chart </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to figure out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how long to wait </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">breastfeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after drinking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to the </span><a href="https://www.beststart.org/resources/alc_reduction/pdf/brstfd_alc_deskref_eng.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motherisk alcohol and breastfeeding chart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one drink every two hours doesn’t apply until you hit 180 pounds. For women who weigh significantly less, 90 pounds for example, they’re looking at closer to three hours a drink to ensure their breast milk contains no alcohol. And keep in mind that alcohol concentration peaks in breast milk </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/alcohol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30-60 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after you’ve had a drink (longer if you’re eating at the same time). So while you may have sobered up, your milk might not have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth mentioning, however, that your baby isn’t getting the same amount of alcohol that you are. If you breastfeed after a glass of wine, which typically contains 12 percent alcohol, your baby isn’t drinking breast milk with 12 percent alcohol. Even if that glass of wine raises your blood alcohol level to </span><a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/sidl-rlcfa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.08</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which is over the legal limit for driving), your baby is still only consuming breast milk which contains 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 mL of fluid. Contrast that with the 14 grams of alcohol typically contained in </span><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one standard drink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s clear that what you drink is significantly diluted by the time it reaches your baby.</span></p>
<h2>What are the side effects of alcohol in breastmilk?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the alcohol you’ve drunk is diluted by the time it reaches them, your baby is still significantly smaller than you are. Their liver is also less developed and less able to process alcohol. So significantly less alcohol can affect them. Newborns are at an especially vulnerable and sensitive stage, so it may be best to wait until your little one is a little older (at least over the one month mark) before drinking and breastfeeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of moderate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drinking and breastfeeding on your baby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren’t clear. Studies have shown </span><a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/2/e20174266"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreased nonverbal reasoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in six and seven-year-old children of mothers who drank alcohol while breastfeeding. And the more alcohol the mothers reported drinking, the lower their children’s scores. But it’s unclear if these deficits persisted once the children got a little older. Or if they are exactly related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt, however, that heavy use of alcohol while breastfeeding has </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501469/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely dangerous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effects on babies. These include but aren&#8217;t limited to interrupted sleep, seizures, psychomotor delays, inability to rouse from sleep, and a faint pulse.</span></p>
<h2>Effects of alcohol on breastfeeding</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While heavy use of alcohol affects your baby, even moderate amounts of it can affect your body’s production of breast milk, even temporarily </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802835/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing your supply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alcohol intake also </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/alcohol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increases letdown time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the time between when the nipple is stimulated and when the milk flows out). It’s not entirely clear if these factors alone account for why breastfeeding infants drink less milk and nurse for less time after their mother has been drinking. But each of these elements is likely to mean a fussier-than-normal hungry baby.</span></p>
<h2>Plan ahead</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So given all the fuzzy guidelines, what’s a mom to do? Well, if you want to have a drink, have a drink! Wine, beer, a martini, it’s up to you. But plan ahead. If you can, breastfeed before you drink. Baby can also drink pumped or hand-expressed breast milk so you don’t have to nurse if you drink too much. Drink your beverage slowly, and have a snack to slow down the intoxicating effects. If you have your baby with you, make sure you have a designated “baby holder” nearby to hand them off to if you feel addled or a little tipsy. Parenting while intoxicated can be extremely dangerous and bumps and falls can be deadly for infants. And under no circumstances should you bed share with your child after you’ve had any amount of alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, “pumping and dumping” isn’t actually helpful. It </span><a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-3/230-234.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t decrease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the amount of alcohol in your milk because it correlates with your blood alcohol level. Much like you, nothing sobers up your breast milk except time. Having said that, if your breasts are uncomfortably full because of missing a feed while drinking, it’s ok to express some milk until you&#8217;re comfortable again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pregnancy means nine months of sobriety, leaving many new moms looking forward to a glass of wine upon delivery. While not drinking if you&#8217;re breastfeeding is your safest option, having the occasional drink is fine. Just make sure to limit yourself to one at a time and don’t drink every day. It might be frustrating, but you only breastfeed for such a short amount of time in your life. It’ll be over before you know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you are concerned about your drinking, please speak with your doctor. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Our skin covers our entire body — it’s the biggest organ we have and it might just be the one we pay attention to the most. When your skin looks good and feels healthy, chances are you do too. But when you have a problem with your skin, the discomfort can be much more than physical. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Now you can get a dermatologist&#8217;s assessment in 24 hours or less — from the comfort of your home!</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/dermatologists/">Dermatologists</a> can assess and treat over 3,000 conditions — everything from alopecia and nail infections to <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/acne-treatment/">acne</a>, psoriasis and skin cancer. To get an in-person appointment, however, you first have to visit your family doctor for a referral. From there, it might be weeks (or months) before they call back with a date — Canadians wait an average of 90 days to see a dermatologist. That’s a lot of time to have an issue both physically uncomfortable and socially embarrassing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin issues can even cause mental health challenges, as some of us experience </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378256/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social anxiety and depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a result of our condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advancements in telemedicine are offering new options, however. Most dermatology assessments are done with the naked eye without ever needing to touch the patient. Because of this, dermatology might just be the perfect medical specialty to go virtual. All you need is the camera on your phone and a description of your symptoms. </span></p>
<h3>What is tele-dermatology?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online dermatology (or tele-dermatology) is exactly what we described above. A dermatologist looking at pictures and the history of a patient’s condition in a file sent by phone or computer. This allows them to diagnose and formulate a treatment plan, all without having to see the patient in person. Studies show that whether you see a dermatologist in person or virtually, you receive the same level of care and experience the same rate of symptom remission. As long as the photos are good quality, outcomes are </span><a href="https://journals.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/JISfTeH/article/view/161/html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients using tele-dermatology versus in-person consultations. </span></p>
<h3>What can online dermatology help with?</h3>
<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, there’s a litany of skin, hair and nail concerns that dermatologists treat. These include <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/flu-treatment/">acne</a>, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/hair-loss-alopecia-treatment/">alopecia (hair loss)</a>, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/rosacea-treatment/">rosacea</a>, psoriasis, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Rashes-treatment">rashes</a>, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Eczema-treatment">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Nail-Infections-treatment">nail infections</a>, dermatitis, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/Pigment-Disorders-treatment">pigment disorders,</a> and <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/conditions/shingles-treatment/">shingles</a> to name a few. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online dermatology is also convenient for managing chronic skin issues as patients often have multiple follow-up appointments to track any changes.</span></p>
<h3>How do I use Maple if I need a dermatologist?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need a referral for our service as we work directly with Canadian dermatologists through our platform. To request a consultation, <a href="https://app.getmaple.ca/login">log in</a> to your Maple account, click “see doctor” and select “dermatology”. Then, fill in a detailed description of your concern and attach any images you feel are necessary for review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the dermatologist analyzes your file, you’ll receive a full report including any advice, treatment plans and diagnoses that the dermatologist believes are necessary — in 24 hours or less! </span></p>
<h3>Where is online dermatology available?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our online dermatology service is currently available in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Nunavut and Newfoundland and Labrador. We hope to expand the service to additional provinces in the coming months.</span></p>
<h3>Are prescriptions included?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes! Our dermatology service allows for a wide variety of prescriptions at the doctor&#8217;s discretion with the exception of controlled medications such as narcotics. Once you accept a prescription, you’ll have the option to pick it up from any pharmacy or we’ll deliver it right to your door at no additional cost.</span></p>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultations aren’t covered under provincial health plans since they’re conducted via secure text message, and often with an out-of-province doctor to ensure your request can be picked up quickly. They cost $180 and include the applicable diagnosis, and any necessary treatment plans or prescriptions. You can also book 15-minute follow-up appointments for $90, if you or the dermatologist would like to follow your condition. For those with health insurance, we always recommend checking with your provider to see if our services can be covered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re worried a weird mole is something more ominous, or you’re having a psoriasis flare up, seeing a dermatologist should be your first stop. Virtual dermatology can make it happen a whole lot faster.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>For months, Paul Young hadn’t been able to sleep.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the administrator for community hospitals in Western PEI, Paul is directly responsible for the operation of two hospitals. This includes Western Hospital, located in the rural community of Alberton, population 4,000. Western Hospital is the acute care centre of excellence for the region. It serves about 15,000 people, and with 50 full-time employees, it is one of the community’s largest employers.</p>
<p>Paul was losing sleep, because like many rural communities, Western PEI is experiencing a doctor shortage. Western Hospital had traditionally relied on a team of dedicated family physicians making the trip up to the hospital. There, they would round on their individual in-patients and track their progress.</p>
<p>With existing chronic vacancies in the physician complement and several retirements, it had become impossible for local doctors to manage all the in-patient care needs for the Hospital. Instead, Western Hospital had become reliant on locum doctors (like supply teachers, but for doctors), to bridge the gap. There would often be a different doctor each week and sometimes every day. The administration was struggling to fill the gaps in coverage week in and week out, which was not sustainable.</p>
<h3>The situation wasn’t working</h3>
<p>Locums were becoming extremely difficult to find. Because of this, Western Hospital needed to identify a sustainable model to ensure consistent physician coverage by the end of summer 2018.</p>
<p>Paul’s team made it their mission to reach out to other rural hospitals across Canada, in hopes of finding solutions. But their research provided no viable options. What they found was that hospital after hospital was reducing services or closing completely when up against this same challenge.</p>
<p>Working so intimately with the communities, Paul knew first-hand what residents were facing.</p>
<p>“There’s a large number of folks who cannot afford to travel back and forth to other cities, or who don’t have the means to do so for appointments or to visit their loved ones in the hospital. We’re in a rural area where transportation is a challenge; there are no taxis, there is no Uber. They’re often dependent on family and friends, and what we were hearing from folks is that if they couldn’t get care here, in some cases, they’re just not going to get it.”</p>
<p>So Paul kept searching for solutions. But as 2018 advanced, he says he could no longer “see a light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
<p>All this was playing out in Paul’s head one morning, driving to Western Hospital, when he turned on CBC radio. The interviewer was speaking with Dr. Brett Belchetz, the CEO of Maple, and Paul realized that he was hearing an answer to his problem: telemedicine.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Within minutes of sitting down at his desk, Paul fired off an email and soon found himself in talks with the Maple team, discussing how to help Western Hospital.</p>
<p>After looking at several ways to ease the hospital’s staffing issues, Health PEI and Maple landed on using Maple’s physician network to manage a tele-rounding process. Though used in hospitals in other countries, this would be the first time a tele-rounding platform would be used in Canada. Complicating that, it needed to be built from scratch and implemented in only 88 days.</p>
<p>Paul knew he had to have every member of the hospital staff on board to make the project successful. He took the idea to the various departments and remembers saying: “This will only work if we are all in. We can’t promise it will work &#8212; but we do know what will happen if we don’t at least try. We need everyone collaborating and being more creative than we have ever been before. We all have to make that commitment. If not, we may as well throw in the towel now.”</p>
<p>He left with consensus &#8212; everyone was in, and willing to do whatever it would take to make the project work. Paul continues, “They also knew, that if the pilot was a success, they would have a role in possibly changing the course of history for rural healthcare coverage in the rest of the country.”</p>
<p>The initial hurdles were huge, but the team was committed and determined, and had the full backing of the community and the province. Once the required regulatory huddles were addressed to make the program possible, a group of more than 50 members, from the local community, hospital staff, Health PEI, MS PEI and Maple, set out to build design the tele-rounding program.</p>
<h3>What’s tele-rounding?</h3>
<p>The project launched in August of 2018. Every morning since then, a registered nurse at Western Hospital logs into the custom-developed technology on a specially designed cart. Through the platform, they connect with a remote physician located outside the region, often in another part of the county. The nurse then wheels the cart into each patient’s room. Once there, the doctor talks with both the patient and hospital staff through multi-way video. Though the doctor might be in Ontario or Nova Scotia, they travel room to room with the cart to see each patient, conducting rounds much the same as they would in person.</p>
<p>Nurses conduct any physical examination maneuvers, such as listening to hearts, feeling abdomens or getting patients up and walking. To help them, the platform can also integrate with other technologies like digital stethoscopes which can make live recordings of hearts and lungs.</p>
<p>Doctors take detailed patient notes and nurses can include images (such as wounds over time) or referral letters, directly in the Maple platform. These innovative features make communication between the hospital staff and doctors across the country easy, ensuring seamless tracking of care.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>Patient experience is central to Health PEI, so initially there were nerves, as the team wondered how patients would respond. But once the interactions between the patients and the doctor began, these fears slowly melted away. “We’ve had a great response from our patients; after the first day, some of them noted they didn’t even notice the TV anymore, it just seems like a regular interaction,” says Paul.</p>
<p>The application also has additional benefits. Patient action plans are streamlined, as multiple healthcare providers can view patient notes, message and video-conference as a team. All of this without the “telephone tag” that often happens.</p>
<p>For Paul Young, there is no question that the Maple platform provides access to the medical services the community deserves: “Telemedicine has allowed us to provide the access to care that otherwise wouldn’t be available in Alberton. If I hadn’t heard that CBC interview, I’m not sure what we would have done.”</p>
<p>He continues, “Before this project, staff at Western Hospital were spending their time putting out fires, just to keep things going. With tele-rounding in place, we have been able to take a proactive approach. Resources are now being used to support levels of care, and to deliver the highest level of service while we actively recruit to fill our physician vacancies. And in this case, we have been very impressed with the calibre of the physicians provided through Maple. They are really going the extra mile to provide good quality care and are really experienced.”</p>
<h3>Evaluating success</h3>
<p>The project is still in its pilot phase, and everyone is waiting for the six-month mark to assess comprehensive data. But so far there has been no downtime for the platform and staff have embraced the technology. Most importantly, the community surrounding Alberton has stable, accessible, physician care for the hospital.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Your breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer. Here's what you need to know.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that </span><a href="http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/breast/statistics/?region=on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in eight Canadian women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and one in 31 will die from it, having reliable information on prevention and screening is crucial. </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Angelina Jolie </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly disclosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that she had undergone a double mastectomy. This created wider awareness of the role played by genetics, and specifically the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, in incidences of breast cancer. Most Canadian women have heard about getting regular mammograms, and know that smoking is a huge risk factor. Drinking alcohol is also high on the list, as are things that are significantly less controllable &#8212; </span><a href="http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/breast/risks/?region=on#certain_genetic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">birth weight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyone? Breast density, however, is a less well-known risk factor, and is only beginning to receive adequate publicity in Canada. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the risks?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have dense breasts, you are four to six times more likely to develop breast cancer than a woman who is lowest on the breast density scale. This is true even if you’ve never had a family member with breast cancer. Given how significant the correlation between the two is, you’d think that it would be part of the conversation your doctor has with you when they check your breasts, right? Unfortunately, that depends on where you live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different provinces have different rules, and in many places in Canada, your doctor may not even know if you have dense breasts. And if your doctor doesn’t know, then how would you? And that’s the thing, you most likely don’t know. Having dense breasts is both normal and common. You can’t tell just by touching them, or by looking at them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly is a dense breast?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, it’s a breast that has more glandular and fibrous tissue, as opposed to fatty tissue. More specifically, there are four categories of breast density, ranging from A (fatty) to D (extremely dense). In between, you have B (scattered areas of density), and C (heterogeneously dense). The size, shape, or the way a breast feels, has nothing to do with its density. The only way to know, is by having a mammogram. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does breast density affect mammogram accuracy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do they have a higher risk of breast cancer, but women with dense breasts are also less likely to have their cancers spotted. While fatty tissue shows up as dark on a mammogram, the dense areas of a breast show up as white. Guess what else shows up white on a mammogram? Cancer. This means that in dense breasts, the radiologist is less likely to see a tumour if one is present. Many women think that once they’ve had a mammogram come back as negative, they are free and clear.</span></p>
<p>If you have dense breasts, you may want to consider additional screening if you receive a negative mammogram — <a href="http://www.densebreastscanada.ca/faq/">research</a> has shown that additional ultrasound screening can detect previously undetected cancers on a mammogram.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, women with dense breasts are more likely to develop interval cancers. What’s an interval cancer? Well, it’s a cancer that has appeared in the interval since your last mammogram. In some cases, this may be because the cancer wasn’t spotted initially.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I mitigate my risk?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well for starters, women 40 and over should speak to their doctors about their risk factors for breast cancer, and women over 50 should be having mammograms every two years. Every woman should be aware of factors that increase the incidence of breast cancer. In the meantime, working towards living a healthier and smoke-free life should be at the top of everyone&#8217;s list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you should talk with your doctor about your breast density. Ask if they know about the link between breast cancer and breast density, and ask them to check with the radiologist to figure out where you fall on the spectrum. If it turns out that you have dense breasts, discuss your lifestyle and family history with your doctor, and talk to them about screening with ultrasound. Knowing about your breast density could save your life.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot about cannabis that we still don’t know. After decades of illegality, Canada is only the second country in the world to fully legalize it. Discussions have centered around it being “less dangerous” than alcohol, but there are still concerns regarding the use of the drug, especially where young people are concerned. Here’s what you need to know about cannabis safety.</p>
<h2>What is cannabis?</h2>
<p>Cannabis contains hundreds of chemical compounds, but the two you’ve likely heard about the most are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the psychoactive part of the drug — the part that makes you feel “high.” CBD isn’t psychotropic, and has many different therapeutic uses attributed to it. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550724">New research suggests</a> CBD can actually counter the effects of THC. This means users experience less impairment consuming strains where CBD content is higher than THC.</p>
<h2>What are the effects?</h2>
<p>Marijuana affects each person differently, and the experience can vary dramatically depending on small environmental changes. Smoking cannabis alone in your backyard for example, might be enjoyable. That same joint at a party with a group of strangers however, could leave you feeling terrible. Individual physiology, THC and CBD levels in the drug, the method of consumption, and whether you have ingested additional substances, can also alter the experience. Anyone with a pre-existing <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/weed-is-legal-now-so-why-use-medical-marijuana/">medical condition</a> should consult with their doctor before taking cannabis, as physiological effects can include <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/health-effects/effects.html">decreased blood pressure</a> causing fainting, and increased heart rate.</p>
<h2>Is all pot created equal?</h2>
<p>In short, no. But measuring the potency of individual strains of cannabis is currently an issue. The federal government has convened a task force to make recommendations on whether there should be limits on the amount of THC in products, but they have yet to make suggestions. And a recent <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-marijuana-thc-cbd-legalization-1.3861144">Marketplace investigation</a> found that labels stating the percentage of THC and CBD were widely inaccurate. Given that higher levels of THC have been correlated with an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801827/">increased risk</a> of psychotic episodes, consumers must be aware of the potential, though unlikely, harm.</p>
<h2>Are there long-term risks?</h2>
<p>In addition to the unpleasant short-term effects associated with a “bad trip,” consuming cannabis can also cause long-term issues. Despite persistent urban legend, marijuana <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/a-very-dark-place-one-woman-s-experience-with-cannabis-dependence-1.4106615">can</a> be addictive. Long-term use can lead to memory and attentional difficulties as well. Over time, regular use of cannabis can even cause a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22927402">decline in intellectual abilities</a>. The effects become more widespread the more you use, the younger you start, and the longer you use the drug. And some of these effects appear to be permanent.</p>
<h2>Is it safe for teenagers?</h2>
<p>Across the country, age requirements for legal consumption vary between 18 or 19 years of age. Research has shown, however, that the part of the brain which governs skills like self-management and impulse control, the prefrontal cortex, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892678/">continues developing</a> into the mid-twenties. As marijuana can negatively affect this region of the brain, youth should be wary of using it until age 25 at least.</p>
<h2>Can cannabis cure morning sickness?</h2>
<p>Despite what the internet might tell you, marijuana is not a reasonable remedy for morning sickness. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has been explicit in its <a href="https://sogc.org/files/letSOGCstatementCannabisUse.pdf">condemnation</a> of this. Pregnant women should not consume marijuana as it is correlated with reduced birth weight. It can also negatively affect a child’s attentional abilities and executive functioning later on in life. Breastfeeding mothers should also abstain, as THC transfers to their children through breastmilk.</p>
<h2>What about smoking and driving?</h2>
<p>Driving high doesn’t make you a better driver. A recent <a href="https://www.cpha.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/resources/cannabis/Pot%20+%20Driving%202018/pot+driving_faq_e.pdf">survey</a> of individuals who had used marijuana in the last year, showed that many of them admitted to doing so and then driving. This despite clear evidence that <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/cannabis-legalization#section-3">response time</a> is slowed while under the influence of cannabis. The Canadian Public Health Association released <a href="https://www.cpha.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/resources/cannabis/Pot%20+%20Driving%202018/pot+driving_faq_e.pdf">guidelines</a> cautioning drivers against driving for a minimum of six hours after smoking marijuana. Individuals who consume <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/edibles-versus-smoking-cannabis/">edibles</a> should not drive for at least eight hours afterwards, though in both cases they might no longer feel “high” after a period of as little as one to two hours.</p>
<p>Despite its legality, marijuana, like alcohol, is undoubtedly a drug, and its effects can vary widely from person to person. If you are going to partake, make sure you know the risks. And as always, if you’re at all unsure, talk to your doctor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>We’ve seen the stats, we’ve observed real life, and we’re very aware of the underrepresentation of women in the workforce.</h4>
<p>For every 100 men in the Canadian workplace, there are 87.62 women. If these are the ratios for the entire labour market, you can imagine the disparity of women in the technology sector. Women in Communications and Technology (WCT) reports that in 2017, only 26.7% of women were represented in all of Canada’s information and communications technology industry (ICT).</p>
<p>According to #MoveTheDial, this number shrinks further when you look to the top-end of the tech sector:</p>
<ul>
<li>6% of tech companies have a female CEO</li>
<li>13% of the average tech company’s executive team are women</li>
<li>8% of directors on boards of Canadian tech companies are women</li>
</ul>
<p>Maple is different. 70% of our employees are women, which makes us an outlier in the tech industry. With a female co-founder and COO and a 63% female executive team we’re representing women at every level of the business, and turning the gender gap on its head.</p>
<p>In celebration of Women’s Equality Day, we’re highlighting the experience and advice of the inspiring women working at Maple.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roxana-zaman-464a9b21/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3B19zu5z1lTdCN3P930h%2BhVA%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=H84lcmUcSKKujXhuJWmyTg%3D%3D">Roxana Zaman</a> – Co-founder &amp; COO</h3>
<p>“I never intended to enter the tech industry. It just sort of happened. My academic background is in finance and economics, and I joined the corporate banking world right after graduating university. Working in tech isn’t really all that different. Aside from the technology itself, my work is about people, and solving problems.”</p>
<p>The thrill of a good challenge is one of the reasons Roxana decided to help build Maple from the ground up. “We’re using technology to connect people and healthcare providers in an instant, at any time of day, or night. As Canadians, we’re incredibly proud of our healthcare system and the quality of our doctors, but quick access to care is a struggle for many of us.”</p>
<p>Roxana continues on Maple’s hiring philosophy:</p>
<p>“Our vision, passion for innovation, and inclusive culture, have played a crucial role in our ability to attract top talent. In the process of building and growing our team, we’re here to support and empower other women to join Maple, and to excel together in our journey as a tech company.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christy-prada-7488b618/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=TlWxEs56TSyMwVD%2FNGO98Q%3D%3D">Christy Prada</a> – VP, Business Development</h3>
<p>Christy is a former consultant in KPMG’s healthcare strategy practice, and she holds an MBA from the Rotman School of Management. At Maple, Christy is primarily responsible for building strong, successful partnerships with various Canadian organizations, including employers, insurers, government entities, and other types of healthcare institutions.</p>
<p>“Working in a tech start-up environment shouldn’t be intimidating. I think there is a general misconception that you have to be a tech wiz to work in tech. I understand technology, analytics, and data, but I am by no means an expert. In order to build a successful tech company, you need people with many different backgrounds and skill sets.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrampersad/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BBk6bVifTRAKnWjPUOqF9Ew%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=pMpYhnDdTmux3Gd0UjDc5A%3D%3D">Shelly-Ann Rampersad</a> – Director, Virtual Hospital Services</h3>
<p>Shelly-Ann is a former strategy consultant with experience implementing system-wide health programs for governments around the world. She also holds an MBA from the Rotman School of Management. Under her leadership, we’re pushing the boundaries of innovation and bringing Maple into Canadian hospitals.</p>
<p>“To an extent, the tech world is very similar to the strategy consulting world — where the experience changes day by day (or even hour by hour) and is truly shaped by your attitude and what you make of it.”</p>
<p>Shelly-Ann’s love for working in a fast paced environment and ability to build things from the ground up is why she excels at Maple. “For me, working in this industry is less about working for a tech start-up and more about finding work that I am passionate about.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsy-maren-fong-csp-2243672/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=s9T5bpPaSSKJK7B6xRfqrg%3D%3D">Lindsy Fong</a> – Director of Sales</h3>
<p>“I come from a corporate background with a decade of experience in business. The technology industry has always piqued my interest, but I felt I didn’t have the skills to be part of the tech sector. I joined Maple as a Director of Sales not knowing what to expect.”</p>
<p>Lindsy admits that understanding all the technology and systems felt a bit overwhelming at first. “Part of my role involves showing clients the value Maple can bring to their organization and teams, so understanding how the technology works is very important.”</p>
<p>Lindsy’s advice to women interested in tech:</p>
<p>“If you’re a woman, and you want to be a part of the tech industry, you should take a shot! Don’t be afraid that you don’t know everything about tech — with determination and drive you can learn. And find a mentor to help support you through the tough times. There are lots of great female leaders in tech now to be inspired by – read about their stories and reach out for answers to your burning questions.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliyaparanych/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BBk6bVifTRAKnWjPUOqF9Ew%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=udua7HpLT4WHh3HX5D2gbg%3D%3D">Nataliya Paranych</a> – Director, Growth</h3>
<p>Nataliya started her career at TD right after graduating from university. She spent more than 6 years working within TD’s various businesses, including wealth management and retail banking strategy.</p>
<p>“Switching industries wasn’t easy at first. What made it feel more comfortable was having other female role models in tech to look up to. Without this, I might not have made the move, and I couldn’t be happier with my choice.”</p>
<p>“Today, I’m responsible for turning Maple into a household name in Canada and beyond. I enjoy using my skills in strategy to help spread awareness about what we’re doing for the healthcare industry – my hope is that Maple becomes synonymous with virtual care in Canada.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiemmackay/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3B19zu5z1lTdCN3P930h%2BhVA%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=qYoS6oPzQr%2BqAMq%2F%2BAdGJw%3D%3D">Katie MacKay</a> – Manager, Communications &amp; Projects</h3>
<p>“I spent 6 years working in PR agencies, creating strategies, content and events at breakneck speeds. When I left, the most terrifying thought was that I might end up doing a predictable, 9-5 job.”</p>
<p>“I need to be tackling something new every day, and constantly analyzing results to make smarter moves in the future. With that in mind, I knew a tech start-up was exactly where I needed to land in my next career. When I was introduced to Maple, I couldn’t believe my luck. I’ve always been passionate about healthcare so I knew this is where I belonged.”</p>
<p>“I’m amazed by how collaborative the team is. If I don’t understand why we’re doing something, I simply ask the resident expert, who very likely sits less than 50 feet from me. It’s an unbelievably tight-knit atmosphere.”</p>
<p>Katie’s advice to women interested in tech:</p>
<p>“If you want to be part of a tech start-up, take the leap! Maple may be an outlier with such a female-oriented workforce, but every woman I know who works in tech finds it incredibly rewarding. There’s no such thing as a “man’s industry” anymore.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanagvasconcelosen/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3B19zu5z1lTdCN3P930h%2BhVA%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=pdKlp6psTg2PzClqImxJdQ%3D%3D">Joana Vasconcelos</a> – Office Manager</h3>
<p>Joana has plenty of experience working for tech start-ups. “I enjoy working in this type of environment because of the evolving nature of the industry. It gives me the opportunity for self-development, and an opportunity to be an active contributor to the company’s culture.”</p>
<p>Joanna believes that tech start-ups are simply a learning curve, and no one should feel intimidated to join. “We need more women with an active voice to shape the industry – this will lead to more opportunities for everyone.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-mccormick/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BjrUZEEFtTmijSN9BDq5dEg%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=E%2BOXXViaRqmcJdbs56HJQw%3D%3D">Leah McCormick</a> – Front End Developer</h3>
<p>“I really wanted to work for a start-up because of the cohesion and family-like environment. It’s hard to come in as a tiny fish in a massive pond, and it feels nice to have people actually know you, and care to know you. “</p>
<p>“My experience so far has been incredibly rewarding and challenging. I was fortunate enough to be a part of a private career college (HackerYou) that really places importance on getting women into tech, specializing in women (and female-identifying persons) in code. As I began learning the ins and outs of web development and coding, it was inspiring to have so many powerful, influential, and intelligent women teaching me some of the most complex things I have ever learned.”</p>
<p>“Working for a start-up can be a gamble, but if you believe in the company, the product, and your teammates, it’s totally worth it. Tech companies are the future, and anything that’s going to be the ‘next big thing’ has to start somewhere, so it’s great to be a part of something early on and watching it grow and thrive.”</p>
<p>Leah’s advice to women interested in tech:</p>
<p>“GET INVOLVED! Don’t let the male domination of the industry intimidate you. It isn’t male-dominated because there aren’t enough talented women and female-identifying people out there; believe me, I have been so fortunate to be surrounded by them daily. We are just at a crux where we need more talented women interested and involved. There are also tons of resources, communities, and workshops for women in tech. Take the step and you’ll find so many others waiting on the other side with excited smiles and open arms.”</p>

<p>“Originally, I worked in sales, but I didn’t enjoy face-to-face sales. I was more interested in indirect selling through marketing. Joining Maple allowed me to apply my creativity and marketing abilities to better communicate with our consumers on social media.”</p>
<p>“Tech companies come up with a great products, but they may have difficulty in shifting from non-tech language to communicate effectively with their audience. That’s where creative people like me come in.”</p>
<p>Tyra’s advice to women interested in tech:</p>
<p>“Take the leap and be loud – let yourself be an expert and make your voice heard.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-mathews-09844414b/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3BtJGfGDPBSE2R0WQUiytA2w%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people-search_srp_result&amp;lici=T%2F9ekRnQRC27Keyj%2BOFOOA%3D%3D">Elizabeth Mathews</a> – Client Success Specialist</h3>
<p>Elizabeth is a Health Sciences student at the University of Waterloo. She joined the customer support team on a co-op term, as one of the first students to ever work at Maple.</p>
<p>“As a co-op student, it can be hard to be taken seriously, as you are only temporary. It is different for me at Maple. Not only do I feel engaged and challenged, I also enjoy the work environment and the culture. You are not limited to what your job title says – you can dip your hands into many different projects within the company. ”</p>
<p>“Being here, you get to quickly observe the underrepresentation of females in the sector. I see the opposite at Maple, and I think it’s great that the company has such a strong female presence. It doesn’t change anything about the team – we’re all here because we believe in the vision of the company.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We're excited to announce our partnership between Maple and Shift Collab to deliver mental healthcare to Canadians.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/2018/07/05/announcing-on-demand-therapy/">Announcing on-demand therapy</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getmaple.ca">Maple</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re pleased to launch </span>an innovative partnership with <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.shiftcollab.com/">Shift Collab</a></span> to enable Canadians to access on-demand therapy sessions, in an effort to dramatically improve access to mental healthcare.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in Ontario, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/psychotherapist-counselling/">this service</a> will allow anyone to access 50-minute therapy sessions from anywhere in the province through Maple. In these sessions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to address the specific challenges that they are experiencing in that moment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— whether it be to reduce anxiety before a big date, manage the aftermath of a difficult conversation with a partner, or strategies to de-stress after a challenging day of work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand appointment style was designed to give greater flexibility and immediacy, and lower barriers to accessing mental health support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the program, therapists will be available in under 12 hours on Maple’s easy-to-use, secure video platform. As the program grows, the service will be made available outside of Ontario to help even more Canadians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maple allows patients to connect with doctors online about conditions that don&#8217;t require an in-person visit directly from their smartphone, tablet, or computer. Doctors can diagnose, provide advice &amp; counselling, and prescribe medications for many common medical conditions right through Maple. With more than 350,000 patients and over 300 licensed Canadian doctors on the platform, Maple promises patients a live chat or video visit within minutes, day or night </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the shortest wait time for a doctor in Canada&#8217;s virtual care industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shift Collab is a leading therapy provider and mental health education firm, focused on making mental wellness simple, relatable, </span>and actionable. Their team of over 30 therapists and a national network of counsellors have served thousands of clients over the past two years, providing tactical support to help clients navigate everyday mental health challenges.</p>
<p>Challenging the status quo of the healthcare industry is an essential tenet of both groups’ missions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.www.getmaple.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BrettBelchetz.png" alt="" width="141" height="141" />Dr. Brett Belchetz, the Co-Founder and CEO of Maple, explains the core reason for creating Maple from the outset: &#8220;Based on my experience as an emergency room physician, at least half of the cases I see do not require a hands-on physical examination, and there is a tremendous demand for more comfortable and efficient access to care in Canada, so people can feel better, faster,&#8221; says Dr. Belchetz.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.www.getmaple.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MegCircle-290x300.png" alt="" width="141" height="146" />Megan Rafuse, the Clinical Director of Shift Collab, agrees. “We often expect that therapy clients have the availability to put aside their commitments to visit a therapist’s office, when in reality, a meaningful therapy experience can now be delivered through video at the touch of a butto<span style="font-weight: 400;">n. This kind of care is the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current users of Maple will now see an option for a therapy session in their portal when logged in to the browser version of the app. For new users, getting access to a therapist is as simple as going to </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.getmaple.ca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating an account, selecting therapy, and being connected to a therapist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information or to try online therapy, please visit us at </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.getmaple.ca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.shiftcollab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.shiftcollab.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Why? Because now you can instantly speak to a doctor right from your smartphone for advice, diagnosis, or prescriptions.</h4>
<p>We wanted you to be able to see a doctor right from your phone. Since launching Maple last year, we&#8217;ve had thousands of patients across Canada log in from a laptop or computer to see a doctor for common medical issues via our live chat or video service.</p>
<p>After all, getting out of the house or the office to see a doctor when you are sick is not always easy. Why sit in a doctor&#8217;s office next to other sick people, or in the ER for hours if you don&#8217;t have to?</p>
<p>With millions of patients globally using solutions just like <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/">Maple</a> to connect with healthcare professionals from their smartphones each and every single day, we knew we had to go mobile! Our teams have been working incredibly hard to create what we feel is the best online care mobile app in the industry. Just how exactly does it work? Keep reading for a super brief summary.</p>
