]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Very few of us expect to receive a cancer diagnosis. This sudden news can leave you feeling paralyzed — like you don’t know where to turn or what to do next. Even just wrapping your head around what your diagnosis means can be difficult since “cancer” is really a collection of different diseases. For some, asking the right questions helps them take an active role battling the disease. For others, knowing all the nitty gritty details can feel like it’s adding extra stress.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong way to <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/blog/tips-for-navigat…cology-treatment/">navigate your cancer treatment</a>. But if you’d prefer to be more informed, here’s a list of starter questions that will give you a well-rounded view of your case.</p>
<h2>What is my exact diagnosis and how was it determined?</h2>
<p>Every cancer diagnosis is unique, but cancers themselves can be divided into a few categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melanoma</li>
<li>Sarcoma</li>
<li>Glioblastoma</li>
<li>Lymphoma</li>
<li>Leukemia</li>
</ul>
<p>There are over 100 different diseases that can be classified as cancer, and they affect all parts of the body.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing exactly what type of cancer you have is the first step in becoming an informed patient. From there you can research the best ways to take care of yourself, what treatments are recommended, and what clinical trials you might be eligible for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your doctor may have diagnosed you via biopsy, tumor removal, physical exam or imaging tests. This information is important to have on hand as well, as you might need to undergo further testing before you begin treatment.</span></p>
<h2>What is the stage of my cancer?</h2>
<p>The “stage” of your cancer refers to how advanced it is at the time of diagnosis. Where your cancer is located, how far it’s spread, and whether any other areas of the body are affected are all important details.</p>
<p>The stage of your cancer influences your treatment plans and your chances of recovery. Like most diseases, cancer is more easily treated if caught early. Knowing your stage can help your doctor set expectations for your treatment roadmap.</p>
<h2>How can I optimize my health from now until my treatment date? What risk factors can I eliminate from my life?</h2>
<p>Since cancer treatment can take a toll on your body, it’s helpful to be fit and healthy before the process begins. Some lifestyle habits are risk factors for developing or accelerating cancer. Eliminating these risk factors can slow the progression of your disease, and help you feel a lot better throughout your treatment.</p>
<p>Some steps you can take to lower your risk factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quitting smoking, and avoiding secondhand smoke.</li>
<li>Using sunscreen when exposed to UV rays.</li>
<li>Avoiding alcohol, or drinking in moderation. Women are advised to consume less than 10 drinks a week, and men should aim for under 15. Have some days of the week where you don’t drink at all.</li>
<li>Eating a healthy, balanced diet. Minimize processed foods, especially processed meats. Emphasize whole plant foods that have vitamins, minerals and fiber.</li>
<li>Keeping a healthy weight. Low-impact exercise can help with this, but don’t push yourself and consult with your doctor on a safe workout regimen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting rid of these risk factors will boost your health and help you gain strength before your treatments begin. Patients who take an active role in their health are shown to have fewer side-effects and better outcomes overall. Consult with your doctor to discuss which risk factors you can eliminate from your life, and create a safe plan to do so.</p>
<h2>What treatment options are there for my type and stage of cancer? Which do you recommend for me?</h2>
<p>The most common types of treatments are surgery, radiation and systemic therapy (like chemotherapy or targeted medication). Your doctor may suggest one or a combination of these treatments.</p>
<p>Since no two diagnoses are alike, your doctor will determine what course of treatment makes most sense given your personal health factors.</p>
<h2>Are there any clinical trials I qualify for?</h2>
<p>Diagnosing and treating cancer is incredibly complex because each patient brings unique factors to the table. Because of this complexity, hospitals and research labs conduct thousands of clinical trials each year aimed at advancing therapies for specific types of cancers. These clinical trial therapies are sometimes more effective than the regular standard of care a hospital might provide.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in these trials, ask your doctor if there are any taking place at their hospital, and if you’d be eligible to participate. You can expand your search as well. Try searching through these sites to find out about trials throughout North America:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com/en-us/patient?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%20cancer%20%20clinical%20%20trials&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=ad10&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjsn9gq_K6AIVhqDsCh15RgbUEAAYAyAAEgLRp_D_BwE">Merck Oncology Clinical Trials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/diagnosis-and-treatment/clinical-trials/?region=on">Canadian Cancer Society</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also reach out to a patient navigator to help you search for trials that apply to you.</p>
<h2>Should I get a second opinion? How do I do that?</h2>
<p>A cancer diagnosis is a very emotional, confusing time. It can be reassuring to see another doctor to confirm you were properly diagnosed and that your treatment plan makes sense.</p>
<p>You might want a second opinion if you were diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, if you want greater clarity into your diagnosis, or if you’d like to look into a greater range of treatments. Your doctor shouldn’t have a problem with you seeking a second opinion.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor to refer you to a colleague who isn&#8217;t closely connected with them. If they’re unable, you can contact a medical society and ask for a recommendation. Ask for an appointment with an oncologist at a different medical institution from the one you’re currently with, as you’ll be cared for by different attendants and pathologists.</p>
<p>Ask for a copy of your medical file to be sent along to your second doctor. Make sure that any test results and biopsy samples are included. You can also ask for a referral letter from your doctor. A patient navigator is a great help in this process.</p>
<p>You can get a second opinion online as well if time and distance are obstacles. We offer <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/oncology-second-opinion/">oncologist appointments</a> over computer, tablet or smartphone. Appointments are usually confirmed within 72 hours, so you don’t have to wait to set your mind at ease.</p>
<h2>Can I speak with a patient navigator?</h2>
<p>A patient navigator is someone who is trained to help cancer patients as they negotiate their treatment. There are lots of emotional and logistical struggles that come up when undergoing cancer treatment. A patient navigator can provide essential support throughout your journey.</p>
<p>A navigator may accompany you to your treatments, suggest questions to ask your doctor, assist you with scheduling appointments, and help you understand symptoms and side-effects you might be experiencing. They can also help you attain financial and legal support if required. Most of all, a navigator is a knowledgeable and empathetic shoulder to lean on during this tough time.</p>
<p>Receiving a cancer diagnosis can make you feel like your head is spinning. Asking questions about your disease can help you feel empowered, and can help you weather your treatment with fewer side-effects. How much or how little information you want is up to you. Know that your diagnosis is unique, and not all the information you read online will apply to you. There’s a lot of steps you can take to put power back in your own hands, and optimize your health even as you’re going through treatment.</p>
<p>If you’d like a second opinion on your diagnosis, or want to speak to a patient navigator, <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/oncology-second-opinion/">click here</a> to read more about our virtual oncology options. You can see a Canadian physician from the comfort of your own home, on a schedule that works for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skincare is an important aspect of health and wellbeing that’s so often overlooked. A lot of us don’t establish a regular skincare routine until we run into an issue, like breakouts in our teenage years, or wrinkles as we get older. That’s because when we’re young, we aren’t taught to take care of our skin on a daily basis like we do our teeth, hair, and diet.</p>
<p>If you have acne, you’re not alone. <a href="https://dermatology.ca/public-patients/skin/acne/">Almost 5.6 million Canadians have acne</a> too, from age 12 to well into adulthood. Because there are several different skin types, and lots of factors that go into having healthy skin, figuring out the best acne treatment for you can be a challenge. The key is getting to know your skin, and sticking to a routine.</p>
<p>In some cases, talking to a pro is most helpful. A <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/dermatologists/">dermatologist</a> can help you tailor a skincare routine and medication regimen that will set you on the road to great skin. To get you started, here’s some tried and true advice that’s dermatologist approved.</p>
<h2>Causes of acne</h2>
<p>Acne is a condition that affects your skin’s pores and oil glands. Doctors still don’t know exactly what causes acne, but factors like hormones and skin cleanliness are thought to play a role. Acne tends to manifest as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Whiteheads</span>: clogged pores that create pimples that stay under the surface of the skin</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Blackheads</span>: pimples that rise to the skin’s surface and are open</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Papules</span>: small, tender pink or red bumps</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Pustules</span>: pimples that are red (resembling papules) at the bottom and have pus on top</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Nodules</span>: red, large and painful pimples that are deep under the skin’s surface</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cysts</span>: painful, pus-filled pimples deep under the skin that often cause redness and scarring</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes acne symptoms are caused by blocked pores. Oil, dirt buildup, and dead skin cells can all be contributing factors. Facial acne and back acne are common, but you can get acne on your chest and shoulders too. To start finding solutions, it’s important to know what your skin type is so that you can use treatments that complement your skin’s composition.</p>
<h2>Skin types</h2>
<p>Did you know there are five different skin types, and that you should use a different acne treatment depending on the type of skin you have? That’s one of the reasons it can be tough to narrow down the best remedy for skin trouble — there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Another tricky factor is that as we age, our skin type can change. External factors like sun or smoking can have an impact on your skin type, and internal factors like hormonal changes also play a role.</p>
<p>The five skin types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Normal</span>: Like the name suggests, people with normal skin type don’t have much imbalance at all, meaning their skin isn’t excessively oily or very dry. They have few imperfections like spots, minimally visible pores, and few wrinkles. Normal skin is most often found in young people</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Combination</span>: This skin type is really common. Combination skin means some areas of the face are dry or oily, while the rest of the skin is normal. Usually the dry and/or oily patches are in the t-zone, which is the area across your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, and across your chin. You may also have blackheads if you have combination skin.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Oily</span>: Because oil can clog pores, people with oily skin often have trouble with blackheads or pimples. Enlarged pores and shiny skin are signs of an oily complexion.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Dry</span>: People with dry skin have small pores, and rough skin that often flakes off. You’re more likely to have skin with less elasticity, which leads to a less vibrant complexion, redness, and wrinkles.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sensitive</span>: Sensitive skin presents itself through irritations like redness or itching, and sometimes burning, especially if you’re using products your skin doesn’t like, which can cause flare ups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prescriptions for acne</h2>
<p>Good news! There are lots of options for acne treatment. A dermatologist can help you choose a treatment that’s right for you. Here are a few common medicines that fight acne:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Topical prescriptions</span>: there are many topical cream options a dermatologist may prescribe to treat acne. Most of them contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients help reduce oil production and inflammation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Oral prescriptions</span>: some types of acne don’t respond to topical remedies, and in those cases there are treatment options in pill form. Commonly prescribed oral medications for acne include: Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Minocycline, and Doxycycline. A dermatologist can help you decide which of these options is the best idea for you.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Hormonal agents</span>: For women, some dermatologists may suggest hormonal oral contraceptives (“the pill”), which are known to alleviate acne.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some medications have side effects, like dry, irritated skin. Others may have more serious side effects, so it’s important to work with your dermatologist to find the solution that’s best for you.</p>
<h2>Simple starts</h2>
<p>Healthy skin starts from the inside out. There are everyday things you can do to clear your skin and maintain a healthy glow. Here are a few ideas to kickstart your acne treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Pay attention to your diet. </span><br />
Avoid fried and sugary food. They spike your insulin production, which causes inflammation throughout your body — including in your skin. Choosing healthy foods like leafy greens has the opposite effect to sugars. They give the body a boost in anti inflammatory properties because they’re rich in vitamin K, which helps fight the redness and swelling that comes with acne.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Build a morning and night routine. </span><br />
Make sure that your morning routine includes products that are well suited to your skin type, and don’t forget to cleanse your face at night to remove the dirt buildup from the day. If you wear makeup, it’s the best way to ensure you’re not falling asleep with anything on your face that might clog your pores.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Drink lots of water. </span><br />
When your skin is hydrated, it’s happy! Proper hydration means your body doesn’t have to produce excess oils to protect the skin, which can contribute to acne breakouts.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Get a good night’s sleep. </span><br />
Your body naturally makes repairs while you sleep — including healing your skin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seeing a dermatologist</h2>
<p>If you’re having trouble managing your acne, or you have scarring, you might want to visit an acne clinic. But, it can take months to snag an appointment. Our <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/providers/dermatologists/">dermatologists</a> are available in 24 hours, and can help you with a wide range of concerns online. They can advise on changes to your routine that will help you achieve clearer skin, write prescriptions, and answer any questions you have about how to make your skin look and feel it’s best.</p>

Face masks can't completely protect you from catching COVID-19, and they may cause you to touch your face more often, which carries its own risks. Some public health authorities are recommending that people wear masks however, since they stop you from unknowingly passing infections to others.</p>

Just like influenza, some of those who are infected show minimal symptoms or none at all.

Unless you're a trained medical doctor, you shouldn't try to diagnose yourself.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few weeks,</span><a href="https://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2020/01/26/answering-your-questions-about-the-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ve probably heard a lot about coronavirus</span></a> (COVID-19)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. The respiratory illness, which has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over three million confirmed cases so far,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started in Wuhan City, China and has since moved through China’s busy airports to countries around the world, including </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of this week, it&#8217;s been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s everything you need to know about coronavirus, from signs and symptoms, to how likely it is that you’ll catch the virus yourself. (Hint: with the information we have now, the risk is much lower than you may think.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is coronavirus? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">coronavirus&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually refers to a group of viruses, including the common cold and flu. The trouble with coronaviruses is that they’re hard to treat because they vary so much from one virus to the next. They also vary from season to season, so figuring out a catch-all cure is difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 — what everyone is simply calling “coronavirus” right now — is a new virus in the coronavirus family, so there is still a lot we don’t know about how it spreads, and how to treat it. We do know that it’s comparable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in that all 3 are coronaviruses that cause flu-like symptoms in people. This doesn’t mean that they’re the same though. They all have varying rates of mortality, and at this stage,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it isn’t proven that coronavirus is as dangerous as SARS or MERS.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the symptoms of coronavirus? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">fever</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cough</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">difficulty breathing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pneumonia</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">headache</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sore throat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fever</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a ge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eral feeling of being unwell</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re experiencing these symptoms and you’ve traveled outside Canada in the last two weeks, you’re at higher risk for having coronavirus. Similarly, if someone you came into contact with is ill and has returned from outside Canada in the last 14 days, there’s an increased risk that you’ve been exposed to coronavirus through them. </span></p>
<p>If you have the above symptoms and you’ve travelled in the last two weeks, it’s important to <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check the latest travel advice and advisories</a> to determine whether you should be concerned.<b> If you think you have coronavirus, contact your <a href="http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local public health unit</a> for further direction and testing.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Residents of Ontario with OHIP coverage can also access our <a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/covid-19-screening/">COVID-19 screening service</a> or contact Telehealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) for more instructions. To avoid the spread of infection, do not go to clinic or hospital before calling. You should also consider wearing a mask to protect yourself and others if you believe you have coronavirus. </span></p>
<p>Our CEO, Dr. Brett Belchetz, recently stopped by Breakfast Television to talk more about these masks, along with other common questions on coronavirus:</p>
<div style="padding-top: 56.156%; position: relative;"><iframe class="rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe" style="border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;" src="https://www.bttoronto.ca/video/iframe/2226196965001/SkX1bBGY/6128622080001" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is coronavirus spread?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, we aren’t certain. However, scientists believe that like other respiratory illnesses, coronavirus probably moves from one person to the next through the spread of droplets expelled when someone coughs or sneezes. When droplets containing the virus spread through the air, they can be inhaled by people nearby, causing infection. Those same droplets can land on surfaces like door handles or counter tops, and live there until someone else picks them up on their hands. If that person touches their nose or mouth before cleaning their hands, just like that, the virus can spread to them too. </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-zoonosis-1.5440146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest coronavirus may also spread from livestock to humans living in highly affected areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of other important facts researchers are still exploring, like whether or not everyone infected with coronavirus actually gets sick, and how long someone with the virus should be quarantined before it’s safe for them to mingle with the general public again. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is coronavirus treated?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus. That’s why prevention is so important. Here’s what you can do to minimize your risk of infection:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. Remember to always lather for at least 15 seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use hand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanitizer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially after using public transportation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sneeze into your sleeve or elbow instead of your hands </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear gloves out in public to keep your hands protected and clean</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid people who are sick</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay home if you’re sick</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think that you have contracted COVID-19, </span><a href="https://app.getmaple.ca/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get in touch with a doctor as soon as you can.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But also keep in mind that not every cold is coronavirus, (it’s flu and allergy season, after all!) and not every traveler you meet has necessarily been exposed to coronavirus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it is definitely important to include details of any recent travel when speaking to your doctor. The information will help medical staff make the most informed decision about how best to treat you or your family member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading to a doctor’s office or emergency room increases your chances of exposure. That doesn’t mean you have to go without seeing a doctor! If you feel sick, need a prescription refill, or you’re simply looking for medical advice, we can connect you to a Canadian doctor from the safety of your home, 24 hours a day. </span><a href="https://www.getmaple.ca/doctors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out how</span></a></p>
